A mayonnaise with fine herb sauce (No. 612) can always accompany this cold piece.","2572":"To be able to dress this entree correctly it will be found necessary to fasten a wooden founda- tion on a dish, having it two inches narrower than the basin of the dish itself; cover it with white paper and in the center attach a wooden support also to be covered with paper; this latter must be in the shape of a pyramid, its base measuring four and a half inches, its top two inches and FIG. 521. its height four inches; cover its surface with a layer of butter. This pyramid or buisson is to be composed simply of large slices of lobster tails and of red shrimps, after suppressing their beards. The shrimps are stuck into the butter on the pyramid in regular circles, but having each row lay in a contrary direction; the slices of lobster are also laid in close circles just on top of the rows of shrimps. As soon as all are dressed cover both shrimps and lobster with half-set jelly applied with a brush. In order to insure its safety it is advisable to push a thick string of sticky jelly (No. 2526) through a cornet, exactly underneath the circle of lobster slices, so as to give them a good support. The hollow formed by the upper row of shrimps can be filled in with chopped jelly or parsley leaves, or else with a crimped paper case filled with a round truffle.

When cold break off the small legs. Generally a buisson of shellfish is dressed on a tin step shelf made with pro- jecting ledges, each one furnished with hooks on which the crawfish can be hung; these ledges are movable and are placed at any desired distance from each other, according to the length of the fish, but there must be no openings left between. The pyramid ought first to be fastened on to the center of a large dish and the empty space filled in with parsley leaves or water cress; surround the base with a bush of green, then fasten on the crawfish by the tails, beginning at the lower ledge. Between the edge of the dish and the pyramid dress the remainder of the crawfish, laying them down flat with the heads turned outward and the claws hanging over. This pyramid after being dressed should be laid on a large tray; have this placed in the center of the table. The green and the pronounced red of the crawfish form a pleasant contrast for the eye to rest upon.","2573":"Roast to a fine color a medium-sized saddle of venison, after having marinated it for two days, and then larded it with lardons (No. 2, Fig. 52); glaze and let stand till cold, then 786 THE EPICUREAN. raise up the sirloin part and cut it in pretty slices, either bias or lengthwise.

These two socles, although differently ornamented, are both constructed on the same principle and on the same plan. 792 THE EPICUREAN. Small socles are intended for decorating a sideboard of small dimensions; they can also be placed on a dinner table, either to figure as a center-piece — should there be no other — or at the ends of the table if there be two, but in that case it will be necessary to have the upper garnishings and decorations dressed on a dish, instead of being directly on the socle, so they can be readily FIG. 528. removed and handed to the guests. In either case the socles should be fastened on a large dish or tray. Each socle stands on a solid, wooden, hollow drum that answers for a base; on top of the socle is another low-shaped drum, also made of wood and covered with white paper, having in its FIG. 529. center a thin wooden support forming a pyramid and arranged in such a way that it can afford a perfect support to the garnishings; this support has on its top a small platform on which can be laid any desired object or subject. The garnishings on the first of these socles (Fig. 527) is composed of small cold chicken or par- tridge galantines made oval, then cut up, reconstructed and covered over with a blond chaudf roid (No. 596). They stand almost upright, leaning against the central support, but to be more assured of their safety it were advisable to inclose each galantine on the bottom with a solid wooden or cardboard shoe, the shape of a horseshoe. The galantines are decorated after they are dressed, and are then covered with half-set jelly. Exactly on top of these galantines lay a row of small paper cases filled with truffles, and fasten them against the central support. On the platform above is set a small Fio. 530. modeled or cast subject. The base of the small drum on which the galantines rest is surrounded by a row of round, even-sized truffles, peeled and glazed over with a brush. The garnishings for the second socle consist of seven or eight large crimped paper cases shaped into half-hearts, pointed on one end and rounded on the other. These cases are filled with a frothy foies-gras preparation made the same as for pheasant cutlets, smoothed dome-shaped and covered with brown chaudfroid sauce (No. 594). The figure on top represents a satyr seated on a rock, under which is laid a row of small cases containing truffles. The base of the small drum on which the garnishings repose may be deco- rated with small cases of truffles or with fine jelly croutons (No. 2442). Let it be observed that the garnishings for these socles can be modified or replaced by others.","2593":"S (Filets de Soles a la Mazagran).

COOKED SALADS (Salades Cuites),","2620":"Rfonoulade Sauce, Pimentade with Tomatoes, Tarragon and Chili Vinegars. — The quan- tity of salad to be seasoned and the necessary proportions must be taken into consideration when using these dressings. When a salad is served no oil should ever remain at the bottom of the bowl; the quantity of oil varies according to the salad. It generally takes three to five spoonfuls of oil for one of vinegar. This can be varied according to taste. Americans do not like the taste of oil in which the taste of the olive is prominent, and therefore prefer a neutral olive oil. \"When a salad is prepared away from the dining-room it is better to put the salt and pepper in a bowl, dissolve them with the vinegar, add the oil and mix well; then pour this over the salad, and stir it in a common salad bowl before removing it to the one intended for the table, this being a much cleaner method. There are glass decanters for mixing the seasonings, adding to them an egg- yolk and a little mustard; shake this well, and by so doing a light mayonnaise is obtained that can be poured over the salad. Another way is to put the salt and pepper into a spoon, add the vinegar, mix with a fork, pour it over the salad and afterward the oil, or else put the salt and pepper into the salad, stir, then add the oil, stir once more and lastly pour in the vinegar, stirring it well again. Tarragon Vinegar. — Fill a two-quart jar two-thirds full with layers of tarragon leaves, shallots and onions; pour over some very strong vinegar and use it two months later, filtering it before doing so.

As soon as the chocolate and gelatine are both well dissolved strain the whole through a fine strainer into a tin basin and set it on the ice, stirring constantly until cold, and when it begins to thicken take it off and incorporate three pints of whipped cream, having it firm and well drained. Fill a jelly mold incrusted on ice with this preparation; let the bavarois harden for two hours, and when serving dip the mold quickly into hot water and invert on a cold dish.","3132":"Coat a jelly mold incrusted in pounded ice with maraschino jelly (No. 3186), and decorate the bottom arid sides with white split almonds, then coat the mold once more with a thick layer of chocolate bavarois preparation (No. 3131); as soon as this is set fill the hollow center with a vanilla bavarois, into which has been mixed a few spoonfuls of freshly peeled and cut up pistachios. Lay a round of paper over and cover with a deep lid filled with chopped ice; leave the bavarois to get thoroughly cold for an hour and a half. Just when ready to serve dip it speedily into hot water and turn it over on a cold dish. Surround the base with small Genoese cakes (No. 3307) iced with strawberry fondant (No. 3652) flavored with kirsch, and decorate with a rosette of halved pistachios.","3133":"Prepare a vanilla bavarois, the same as for No. 3135; pour it into a dozen oval ballotine molds and set them in the ice-box to have their contents get quite hard. When ready to serve unmold the bavarois, and range them in a circle on a dish, keeping them a slight distance apart. On either side of each one place two small meringue shells (No. 116) well scooped out and very dry.","3134":"Put into a bowl one pint of raspberry pulp strained through a tammy, dilute it with three or four gills of cold, thick syrup flavored with lemon and an equal quantity of clarified isinglass. Add to this preparation the strained juice of two oranges. Put a small part on ice to judge of its solidity (it must be rather thick than otherwise), and when perfect pour it into a small untinned copper pan, and thicken it on ice while stirring. As soon as it has acquired the consistency of a thick, smooth sauce, take it off and add to it a pint and a half of firm and well- drained whipped cream. Use this preparation to fill either a jelly mold (Fig. 149) or a plain cylin- drical mold incrusted in chopped ice; cover with a piece of paper and lay on a deep cover, filling it with more chopped ice, then leave to harden for one hour. Unmold on a cold dish after dipping the mold in hot water. Various bavaroises of different fruit pulps can be prepared the same way, such as pineapple, mandarins, currants, almonds and fresh nuts. The mold may be coated on the inside with a light layer of oil of sweet almonds, thus avoiding the necessity of dipping it in hot water.","3135":"Boil one pint of milk with half a split vanilla bean. Whip four egg-yolks well in a basin with six ounces of sugar, dilute them with the boiling milk, and pour the whole into a saucepan to stir over a moderate fire without letting it boil. Remove the cream from the fire as soon as it thickens, take out the vanilla, and add two gelatine leaves (one ounce) previously softened in cold water. 910 THE EPICUREAN. When this is melted pass the whole through a fine wire sieve into a tin basin and leave to cool on ice. As it begins to thicken mix in about three pints of cream, whipped and drained. Fill a jelly mold (Fig. 149) incrusted on ice with this, put on it a round of paper, and then let the bavarois harden for two hours. At the last moment dip the mold in hot water, and invert it on a cold dish.","3136":"Suppress the shells from one pound of good, fresh chestnuts; put them with some water into a saucepan and let cook on a slow fire for two hours, being careful to replace the black liquid by clean boiling water. After the chestnuts are tender, drain, skin and pound them HI a mortar with half a pint of syrup at twenty-five degrees, to reduce them to a fine paste, and press this paste through a sieve into a tin basin. Put four egg-yolks into a bowl and beat them up with four ounces of sugar; dilute with a pint of boiling milk into which has been added half a vanilla bean; pour this into a saucepan and place it on the fire, beating it with a whip until it begins to thicken; then remove at once and add an ounce and a half of gelatine, softened in cold water; when this is dissolved, pass the preparation through a fine wire sieve and add it to the chestnuts in the basin, putting it on pounded ice and beating well till cold. As soon as it begins to thicken incorporate into it a quart and a half of firmly whipped and drained cream; then pour it into a channeled cylindrical mold (Fig. 148) incrusted in ice. Let it harden for an hour and a half. Just when serving dip the mold quickly into hot water and invert the cream on a cold dish, surrounding the base with fine glazed chestnuts.","3137":"Take some oval-shaped lady fingers and as many more shaped round like a bouchee; cover the edges with a thin layer of apricot marmalade (No. 3675); soak the oval ones lightly with maraschino and dress them in a circle on the outer edge of a deep dish; in the center of this place the round biscuits in intermingled layers after they have also been soaked in maraschino, and cover each one of these with a rather consistent English cream (No. 42) prepared with lemon peel and beaten for seven or eight minutes on ice, then mixed with a few spoonfuls of whipped cream.","3138":"Soften one ounce of gelatine in cold water and dissolve it in a gill of orange syrup; add to it a pint of filbert milk, made like almond milk (No. 4), substituting filberts for almonds, and strain into a tin basin. Let this preparation become cold on ice, and just as it begins to thicken incor- porate about three pints of well-whipped cream. Pour this into a dome-shaped mold, cover with a sheet of paper, close hermetically with a lid, and chill in lightly salted ice. One hour will suffice for this operation. Unmold on a cold dish and serve.","3139":"Pound half a pound of freshly peeled almonds, a few at a time; dilute with a quart of cold milk and press the whole slowly through a napkin held by two persons, so as to extract FIG. 588. all the liquid thoroughly; mix into this almond milk three-quarters of a pound of powdered sugar, some lemon peel or half a split vanilla bean, and a quarter of an hour later put into the liquid fifteen clarified gelatine leaves. Strain and try a little on ice to judge of its strength. Incrust a plain cylindrical mold (Fig. 150) on ice, coat it with clear jelly mixed with strawberry SWEET ENTREMETS. 911 Or orange juice and filtered through blotting paper. Stir on ice two-thirds of the blanc-mange to thicken it slightly, using a spoon, and as soon as perfect mix in a fine salpicon of candied pine- apple; pour this into the coated mold and leave it stand for one hour. Thicken the remainder of the preparation on ice, and with it fill five small timbale molds (No. 2, Fig. 137), also incrusted on a thick bed of ice spread over the bottom of a deep sautoir. Three-quarters of an hour later empty out the centers of the small molds with a tin tube dipped in hot water; to remove these pieces it is only necessary to heat the bottom of the molds slightly; replace them on ice and fill the center with some of the same preparation mingled with strawberry juice (No. 3673); let this get hard. Unmold the small timbales and cut each one across in three parts. Dip the large mold quickly into hot water; invert on a cold dish and surround the base with the rings, then fill up the hollow with Chantilly cream (No. 50), flavored with almonds, having it dome-shaped. Surround this dome with a few large strawberries, each one cut in two and dressed flat to resemble a rosette. Serve at the same time a bowlful of strawberry puree sweetened with syrup, having it very cold.","3140":"Make an apricot \" pain\" preparation (No. 3194) a little thicker than usual, into which add the same quantity of rice cooked with cream and vanilla (No. 160), and a few spoonfuls of whipped cream (No. 50); pour it into a Savarin mold, incrusted in pounded ice. Beside this, prepare and mold a macedoine jelly with champagne the same as for No. 31 79, having it in a dome the same diame- ter at the bottom as the hollow in the Savarin mold; put this macedoine in the ice-box to stiffen. One moment before serving unmold the border on a cold dish and in the center place a pad of Gen- oese cake (No. 3239), reaching three-quarters to the top; into this unmold the champagne mace- doine and surround the base with a circle of croutons made of ribboned jelly (No. 3184).","3141":"Fasten a round layer of office paste (No. 143) on a dish and on it place a charlotte mold half an inch narrower than the paste. Prepare a cream cake paste (No. 132) with five ounces of butter, three gills of water, seven ounces of flour, a spoonful of sugar, lemon peel, a grain of salt and five eggs. Put this paste into a socket pocket (Fig. 179), and put it on a baking sheet in the shape of thin even eclairs as long as the mold is high; then bake them in a slack oven until dry, then allow to cool. After the cakes are detached from the sheet, keep them warm for a few moments. When cold, open and fill them with raspberry jam (No. 3695) pushed through a cornet, and glaze over with sugar cooked to \"crack\" (No. 171). As this becomes cold dip one end and one side into the same _ sugar so as to enable them to stand upright on the layer of office paste around the mold. When the sugar is cold lift out the mold and fill the inside of the case with a raspberry bavarois prepara- tion, the same as for No. 3134, thickened on ice, and lastly having a salpicon of candied pineapple added to it.","3142":"Cook a flat of Genoese paste (No. 3239), having it about three-eighths of an inch thick; invert it on a sheet of paper, pare off the upper crust and divide it into two bands, each to be two and three-quarters inches wide; cut one of these bands into short uprights slightly inclined toward the right, having them half an inch wide, and the other band the same width, only inclined toward the left. Put a round piece of paper in the bottom of a charlotte mold, against its sides range a row of these uprights, inclining them according to their cut and alternating those with crusts with those without them. On this first row range a second the same way, only inclining the uprights in the opposite direction. Fill the charlotte with a banana \"pain\" preparation (No. 3J95), and let harden in the ice-box for an hour and a half. Unmold the dessert on a dish, and just when ready to serve place a spun sugar ornament on top.","3143":"Cut in four pieces eight or ten Calville apples; peel and cook them in a covered saucepan with a little water, very little sugar, a bit of lemon peel and half a vanilla bean. When done and all the moisture is evaporated, press them through a sieve. Cover the bottom of a charlotte mold with • lady finger biscuits, or else butter biscuit for charlotte, cooked on a baking sheet covered with paper, three-eighths of an inch thick and cut up into long triangles, and form them into a rosette without any open space whatever between the pieces. From the same biscuits cut some even upright pieces three inches wide and the same height as the mold, which should be kept on ice. Pour the apple pulp into a round-bottomed pan and dilute .with a gill of syrup mingled with a sheet 912 THE EPICUREAN. and a half of gelatine that has been softened and dissolved. Stir the preparation on ice to thicken, and as soon as it begins to set pour in quickly two or three spoonfuls of good rum and then a quart of whipped cream. Two minutes after turn this into the charlotte mold and sur- round it with chopped ice, leaving it thus for one hour, and when needed unmold the charlotte on a folded napkin. (3144). CHAKLOTTE A LA METTEENIOH (Charlotte a la Metternicli) Prepare a paste made by beating three whole eggs in a basin, and when creamy add halt a pound of sugar, as much sifted flour, a pinch of fecula and some orange sugar (No. 3165). The paste should be quite firm. Then force it through a pocket on a buttered and floured baking sheet, having the pieces resemble lady fingers all of the same size, and bake in a moderate oven. Detach them from the sheet and cut one end off of about forty and leave till cold leaning against a support, so as to have them slightly bent on the uncut ends. Dip the cut end of each biscuit into sugar cooked to \" small crack\" (No. 171), drain it off and fasten the cakes upright against the thickness of a round flat of office paste; fasten each piece with cooked sugar, overlapping them slightly so that they form a pretty basket spread out open on the top. When the sugar is quite cold dress the basket on a dish and fill it with chestnut puree sweetened with vanilla sugar (No. 3165) and then mingled with whipped cream. Surround the base with candied chestnuts dipped in sugar cooked to \" small crack.\"","3145":"Lay a round sheet of white paper at the bottom of a charlotte mold and line it all around with well-pared lady fingers (No. 3377). Boil a pint of milk with half a split vanilla bean; beat up in a vessel six egg-yolks with six ounces of sugar and dilute the preparation with the boiling milk; pour it at once into the saucepan and thicken over a moderate fire without letting it come to a boil. Then take out the vanilla and add two leaves of gelatine softened in cold water then melted in a gill of boiling water. Run the whole through a fine Chinese strainer into a vessel and leave to cool until it begins to thicken slightly. Then mix with it the volume of three pints of whipped cream and pouring it at once into the charlotte mold cover with another round of paper and place the mold on ice for an hour and a half. When ready to use invert the charlotte on a cold dish covered with a napkin, remove the upper paper and place on top a cover, made with the same paste as the lady fingers, cut the same dimension as the charlotte, icing it with a white vanilla icing (No. 102) and decorate with a handsome design of preserved fruits or with royal icing.","3146":"Cut a few large lady fingers or charlotte biscuits (No. 3377) into long triangles so as to be able to place them in the shape of a rosette in the bottom of a charlotte mold, pressing them down on their glazed side; cut out the center with a pastry cutter one and a quarter inches in diameter; replace this cut-out piece with a round of biscuit cut with the same cutter; then cut off the ends and sides of a few of the same biscuits so as to stand them upright against the sides of the mold, pressing them close to each other. Incrust the mold in ice. Strain first through a sieve and then through a tammy about two pounds of strawberries or raspberries; sweeten this pulp with some thick syrup flavored with orange peel and mixed with about two gelatine leaves or clear melted calf's foot jelly (No. 104); stir the preparation on ice and as soon as it thickens incorporate into it slowly the volume of a pint and a half of very firm, well-drained and slightly sweetened whipped cream. Fill up the mold with this and let harden for one hour on ice. At the last moment dip the mold into tepid water and invert the charlotte on a napkin."}
