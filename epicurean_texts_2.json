There are several kinds of tinabales; those made with a very thin timbale paste; those of que- nelle forcemeat and those of cream forcemeat, either of chicken, game or fish. The name timbale should only be applied to those made of paste cylindrical-shaped like a footless goblet, or a silver mug, or else half spherical-shaped in imitation of the kettle-drum used in an orchestra and filled with a garnishing of some kind. A \"bung\" would better represent the idea of what is commonly called timbale, and I would suggest the adoption of the French of bung \" bondon, \" for I scarcely believe that the elegance of the bill of fare would be marred by reading: \" Bondons of Pickerel a la Walton,\" or \" Bondons of Chicken a la Reine,\" or \"Bondons of Woodcock a, la Diane,\" or \" Bondons of Pheasants a la Benois.\" I have not the slightest intention of changing the conventional name. I only suggest an idea that might he advantageously followed if so de- sired. For making timbales cylindrical molds (No. 2, Fig. 137) two and five-eighths inches wide by two and one-eighth inches high are generally used; butter the insides with fresh unmelted butter and decorate with fanciful cuts of truffles, tongue, pistachios, etc. They may also be strewn with truffles, tongue, lobster coral and pistachios, all these being chopped up finely and separate- ly, then dried in the air. Fill with forcemeat either with or without a salpicon, then poach; for this consult Elementary Methods (No. 152).

Spiny Lobster (Langotiste), Pali- nurus Locusta. — The spiny lobster has two large horns in front of its eyes, two others underneath and it is with these it catches and draws toward it the fish on which it feeds. Its back is covered with prickles and very rough. During the winter this crus- tacean lives in the deep ocean and is very common in the Mediterranean sea. Its meat can only be digested by robust stomachs and it always re- quires to be highly seasoned.

It is headless, toothless and sexless; it cannot live out of water, and is specially fond of the mouths of rivers. The fishing begins in September, and finishes in the latter part of April; in all the intervening months, or those containing no letter R in their names, the oysters are replaced by Little Neck clams. Fresh FIG. 275. oysters are easier digested in the raw state than when FIG. 276. cooked, for the heat hardens them while the sea water in the raw ones facilitates digestion. Oysters contain plenty of water, very little solid animal matter, a great deal of lime and sulphate of iron, osmazome and gelatin. These bivalves agree with worn-out constitutions, but should be eaten very fresh. Like certain fishes, oysters contain phosphorus.

The scarcity of Chesapeake diamond-back terrapin grows more apparent each year, and even now it frequently requires many days of laborious and tedious work and many miles of walking over soft boggy marshes, of prodding in deep narrow channels with long shafted tongs by men skilled and familiar with all their cunning habits before one is taken from a hiding place, just below the surface, sufficiently deep for protection against the winter frosts. The favorite place FlQ gyo for the hibernation of the very largest size is a few inches below the soft oozy mud at the bed of a three or four fathom V-shaped channel in the bed of a creek of about the same distance from shore to shore. Thousands of such creeks penetrate the shores and islands of the Chesapeake, and those less frequented by man are instinctively selected by the terrapin for its haunts. At least ninety per cent, of those taken from the beds of deep creeks will measure six and one-half to eight and one-half inches with an average weight of nearly two and three-fourths pounds, are females; while eighty per cent, of those bedded in the marshes have an average weight of three-fourths of a pound and measure less than five inches. The males invariably bed in the marshes and among the rushes of very shallow ponds, only venturing in cold water during the summer and the warm- est spring and fall months, in which time they lead a migratory life in search of food, consisting principally of small shell fish and the soft-shell crabs. About ninety-eight per cent, of the male terrapin never exceed five inches in length on the bottom shell, while the female has been known to measure nine inches and weigh seven and one-half pounds. In the month of December, 1885, Delmonico received from Baltimore a Chesapeake Maryland terrapin measuring eight and three-fourths inches, weighing nine and one-half pounds and containing fifty-six eggs; this must be accepted as one of the finest specimens ever found of the diamond-back Chesapeake bay terrapin. The standard length for those who buy and sell terrapin is six inches; when of this dimension they are called \"counts.\" Both the male and female are very shy and active, swim well and run (though awkwardly) with considerable speed. Prior to about 1870 the salt and brackish waters of the bay literally teemed with this now nearly exterminated and hence valuable reptile; they could betaken by the dozen at a single haul of a long net, but the market value was so small as to render them almost worthless except for local use, and in consequence thousands of large egg terrapin were fed away to swine or cooked for fattening fowls. The people, thoughtless and unprincipled, have robbed themselves by trapping incalculable quantities of terrapin before they had matured sufficiently for breeding and by digging eggs from beneath the sand shores where they had been deposited by the females to hatch. While the laws enacted by the legislatures of Maryland and Virginia for their protection differ somewhat they are both excellent, and had they been rigidly enforced this spectacle of ultimate extermination would not exist. The time for hibernation usu- ally lasts about six months, beginning with approaching frosty weather in the fall and continuing till the warm spring weather; they bury a few inches deep in the mud and leave, at the spot where they disappear, a mound in the middle of which a hole can be discerned. It is this mound and its hole which first attracts the attention of the fisherman; during this period an enormous quantity of terrapin are caught in their torpid state. They take no nourishment whatever while in this condition. They hatch their young toward the end of June and the beginning of July. The terrapin season is from the month of November to May; they are at their best during Decem- ber, January, February and March. Very often terrapin are sent to market in October and Nov- ember, also penned terrapin of the year before. Penned Terrapin.— Are those caught beforehand and kept in an enclosed place; they are fed on oysters, crabs or fish; these terrapin are never so good as those freshly caught. The small species of terrapin are divided into two classes: heifers, the under shell of these never measuring more than five inches in length, and bulls five to five and a half. Terrapin begin to hatch their MOLLTJSKS A1STD CRUSTACEANS. 421 eggs at the age of four years; while growing their shell lengthens one inch every year, so their age may be approximately judged by their length, for example: a six-inch terrapin is supposed to be six years old.

MOLLUSKS AND CRUSTACEANS. 423 To Select Terrapin.— To buy terrapin See Schedules or Tables Nos. 1 and 2. When buying terrapin be careful to observe that the extreme tip or muzzle of the head is not injured, that the bottom of the feet are not worn off, that the head is prettily shaped, small thin and pointed, the eyes brilliant and the feet small and slender. The superiority of their race is made apparent by their fine appearance. There is no doubt that the diamond-back Chesapeake bay terrapin are far better than any other kind found in the markets. Their price is very high, they being sold on an average of the five to six inch ones or over at a $1.25 a pound or $15.00 to $17.00 a dozen; the six to seven inch ones bring $1.50 a pound or $35.00 to $40.00 a dozen; the seven to eight inch ones bring $1.75 a pound or $55.00 to $60.00 a dozen; the eight to nine inches bring $1.90 a pound or $80.00 to $85.00 a dozen. They should be procured before the extreme cold weather sets into avoid freezing during the trip, for once frost bitten they die easily. To Keep the Terrapin.— In order to keep them properly they must be left in a cold place forty to forty-five degrees Fahrenheit; it should also be clean, well aired, dark and better be too damp than too dry. They must be placed in large or small boxes according to the quantity; range the terrapin in the boxes, pressing them down one beside the other so that they cannot possibly move, and between each bed lay damp sea grass. When packed like this they may be kept for several months. Examine the terrapin now and then. Should there be any dead ones take them out. They must be handled with care, laid one next to the other, not thrown, as they are very tender and delicate and are liable to die easily, incurring a heavy loss, as a dead terrapin is a ruined one and ought to be thrown away at once. No eggs are found in terrapin of less than six inches long.","1082":"Drop the terrapin in sufficient tepid water to allow it to swim, and leave them thus for half an hour, then change the water several times and wash them well. Scald, by plunging them into boiling water, and take out as quickly as the skin (a small white skin on the head and feet) can be removed with a cloth, put them on to cook in water without any salt or seasoning, or else in a steam vessel leaving them for thirty to forty-five minutes, and lift them out as quickly as they are done. In order to be sure of this, press the feet meat between the fingers, and if it yields easily under the pressure, they are ready. Those that cannot be cooked in forty-five minutes are considered of an inferior quality, and those that are not done after one hour (unless they are very large), should be rejected as worthless, for although the meat may eventually become tender, it will be stringy and not have the same delicate taste of a good terrapin. Let them get cold, cut off the nails, then break the shell on the flat side, on both sides near the upper or top one; detach this shell from the meats, empty out all the insides found in this upper shell, suppressing the entrails and lights, and carefully removing the gall bladder from the liver, being very particular not to break it, also cutting away with the tip of a small knife any gall spots to be found thereon, then place the liver in cold water. Remove the white inside muscles, as well as the head and tail; separate the legs at their joints and divide into an inch and a quarter pieces; do not break the bones; the lights, entrails, head, tail, claws, heart, muscles and gall bladder to be thrown away. Lay the terrapin in a saucepan with the eggs and liver cut in thin slices, season with salt, black pepper and cayenne, and cover with sufficient water to attain to the heighth of the terrapin, then let boil and finish the cooking in a slow oven for twenty to thirty minutes; the terrapin is now ready to be used, and can easily be finished by following the recipes found later on. Should it only be required for the next day, place in tin molds or else small China pots, the proportions being at the inside bottom two and three-eighths inches, on top, three inches in diameter, and two and three-eighth inches high. Allow four or six eggs to each, fill them up with terrapin, about six ounces for each, and finish filling with the broth; each mold will contain one portion. When unmolded each one should weigh seven ounces. This quantity will be sufficient for two or three persons for a dinner and for five persons for a buffet.","1083":"Have one quart of prepared terrapin as explained in No. 1082; drain it off. Cook four ounces of butter in a saucepan till it becomes hazelnut butter (No. 567), but watch carefully that it does not blacken; add to it the terrapin with some salt, freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of cayenne, fry for few moments, then moisten with the broth. Dilute one tablespoonful of fecula, arrowroot or cornstarch in a little cold water, pour it in with the terrapin, toss well to thicken nicely, and just when 424 THE EPICUREAN ready to serve add half a gill of good sherry wine.

The sauce should be thick and served very hot.","1087":"Choose a six and a half inch terrapin, scald to remove the skin, and wrap it in several sheets of buttered paper; put it on a baking sheet and set it into a slow oven; it will take about an hour to cook; unwrap, and break the shell; remove the meats, suppress the gall-bag attached to the liver, also any spots found on the same, and cut it up into slices; take away the head, tail, claws, and white muscles on the four members, and then warm the terrapin in a good thick gravy (No. 405), season with salt, freshly ground pepper, cayenne, butter, adding some good sherry wine.

(1297). TROUT AU BLEU— SMALL (Petites Truites au Bleu). Small brook trout live where the water is rapid and pure. There exist certain reservoirs, for instance at the Saratoga Club, where each day the fisherman bring the product of their catch, so that amateurs of good fish may always have on hand trout to be killed just when ready to use; this is an excellent method to bring out all the good qualities of its meat. The various ways of cooking this fish are most simple , kill the trout by knocking their heads against a hard substance, open the belly to draw, clip off the gills and wash out the inside. Plunge into boiling water, salted and acidulated with vinegar, and as soon as it reboils, remove the sauce- pan to the side of the fire to keep the liquid in a bubbling state only for fifteen minutes. Drain the trout, dress it on a napkin, and garnish with parsley and potatoes. Serve at the same time fresh and melted butter.

This fish has the color and taste of the salmon. Toward the middle of spring it leaves the ocean to ascend the rivers; this trout is easily digested and is of an exquisite flavor. Our Ameri- can species is very inferior in quality to those of Europe; they are much larger, and their meat not as red, nor can the taste be compared; therefore epicures are generally disappointed when eating our salmon trout. A r Antoinette.— Score the fish and marinate it in salt, mignonette, lemon juice, chopped onions, parsley, thyme, and bay leaf. Drain and roll it in flour, then in beaten eggs, and finally in bread-crumbs; fry in clarified butter, and serve with a separate sauce made as follows.

It takes about five hours to cook a baron of beef in a baker's brick oven, the best to use for large pieces of this description, after being cooked they should be put in a heater or warm place, for about two hours, to finish cooking slowly. \"When cooked arrange it on a large dish, garnishing on the edges with shavings of horseradish (No. 98) and the ends with Yorkshire pudding (No. 770). Serve thickened gravy (No. 405) well skimmed and strained through a fint sieve, in a separate sauce-boat, also some baked potatoes. (1314). BREAST OR BRISKET 01 BEEF A LA FLORENCE (Poitrine ou Bavette de Bceuf a la Florence). The name of brisket is applied to the part of the beef adjoining the cross ribs, and the neck. If the beef be of a good quality, the plate or brisket makes an excellent and economical boil, the meat being juicy and interlarded with fat giving it a very good flavor. Put a quarter of a pound of butter in a saucepan, and when warm, add half a pound of lean bacon and half a pound of ham cut into squares of a half of an inch. When the bacon and ham are well browned, add four ounces of onions cut into an eighth of an inch squares, and two pounds of brisket of beef well freed from fat, boned and cut into one inch squares.

When ready to be used, drain the corned beef, wash, then boil in plenty of water. For a six-pound piece it will take about two hours and a half. After cooking for one hour, add to it a pudding made of flour and beef suet, also cabbage, onions, and pared carrots and turnips.

Pour into the bottom of the dish a clear gravy (No. 404). The quantity of water requisite to cook the corned beef depends entirely upon the quantity of salt used, and the length of time the beef was in the brine; if the beef is very salty, it will require more water than otherwise, and it is even advisable to change it after the first boil. (1317). EDGffiBONE OR AITCHBONE, BOILED CREAM HORSERADISH SAUCE (Quasi de Bceuf bouilli Sauce Raifort a la Creme), Edgebone or aitchbone, is a bone of the rump which in dressed beef presents itself in view edgewise; it is also called aitchbone.

To roast on the spit, it must be wrapped up or packed in several sheets of strong, greased paper; tie with several turns of string, lay it in a cradle spit (Fig. 116) to cook, which will take about three hours and a half before a good, regular fire. Half an hour before removing from the spit, remove the paper, let brown nicely, then put it on a heater to keep warm for forty- five minutes before serving. To roast in the oven, place the ribs in a baking pan, pour on some fat, and roast it for four hours, carefully basting several times during the cooking; salt and set it on a heater to keep warm three-quarters of an hour before serving. \"When sending the roast to table serve with it a sauce-bowl of good thickened gravy (No. 405) and a dish of mellow potatoes, prepared as follows: Cook some potatoes in salted water for thirty minutes, drain and press them through a colander, adding half an ounce of butter for each pound of potatoes.

Cut from the center a piece weighing, ten, twenty, or thirty pounds, more or less, according to the number of guests to be supplied, cut away the fat, and a piece of the flank seasoning with salt and pepper, and fold the flank over; the meat should be the same thickness throughout. Tie it well, making a knot at each turn of the string. It can be wrapped up in several sheets of buttered paper. A piece of beef roasted on the spit is far preferable to one cooked in the oven. It suffices to place it in the middle of an English cradle spit (Fig. 116), but sometimes FIG. 306. it is impossible to cook it in this way. Therefore the most practical manner is to cook it as follows: Set it in a deep pan with raised edges, and furnished with a grate slightly raised on four feet an inch and a half high (Fig. 306).
