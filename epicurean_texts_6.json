Bake in a slack oven on a baking sheet covered with paper, having it at least half an inch thick, and when done put aside to cool for twelve hours. With seven or eight egg-yolks, some sugar, six gills of milk and a piece of vanilla, prepare an English cream (No. 42) ; as soon as it thickens remove and mix in a quarter of a pound of roasted chopped filberts, and pour it at once into a glazed vessel, working till cold; then strain through a tammy and return it to the saucepan to beat oil a FIG. 595. slow fire for two minutes to have it lukewarm; remove once more and incorporate into it, without ceasing to stir, one-half pound of fresh butter divided in small pats; the cream should now be quite consistent and slightly frothy; divide it into two parts, and color one with carmine mixed with a little syrup so that it acquires a pinkish hue, leaving the other half white. Have a hexagon (six-sided) shaped cardboard pattern and with it cut three or four pieces from the prepared biscuit; split them through their thickness, mask them over with apricot marmalade (No. 3675), and recon- struct them as before; fasten these pieces on a thin Genoese bottom a third of an inch wider than the biscuit, and on this, with the remainder of the biscuit cut thin and also masked with apricot, raise an even pyramid, cut hexagonally; cover it as well as its base with a thin layer of the butter cream. Koast in the oven half a pound of filberts cut up small; when removed besprinkle with fine sugar, and when nearly cold apply them in smooth layers against the thickness of the base on which the pyramid stands, pressing them down with the blade of a knife to equalize the sur- face, leaving no open space whatever between. Introduce a part of the white cream into a small fancy socket pocket (Fig. 179), and push on the surfaces of the pyramid small, plain, close flowers, strictly following the divisions of the hexagon; next to these push some pink flowers, alternating the shades, in the different compartments. When the pyramid is entirely covered push a large rose on top, having the two colors mixed, then with a smaller socket surround the base of the cake with small roses made of the two colors. Keep the cake for a quarter of an hour on ice to have the cream harden superficially, and on removing slip it carefully on a napkin, and serve at once, for the buttered cream must remain hard. LARGE CAKES FOR ENTREMETS. 935","3238":"Proportions. — One pound and a half of butter, a pound and a half of sugar, a pound and a half of flour, twenty eggs, four pounds of seeded Malaga raisins, four pounds of Smyrna raisins, four pounds of citron, ten pounds of currants, two gills of rum, two gills of brandy, four gills of molasses, one ounce of cinnamon, half an ounce of allspice, a quarter of an ounce of mace and a quarter of an ounce of nutmeg. Beat the butter and sugar together in a tinned basin until creamy and white; adding the eggs one by one add the flour and mix perfectly, then put in the Malaga and Smyrna raisins, the currants, the finely cut-up citron and the spices; afterward the liquors and molasses; work until thoroughly mixed. For this quantity have two very strong tin molds twelve inches long at the bottom and five inches wide, with a quarter of an inch splay on each side, the depth to be six and a quarter inches. These molds must be furnished with covers closing on the outside. Butter and line them with buttered paper. Divide the preparation into two equal parts, one into each mold; cover the tops with buttered paper, put on the covers, then set both molds on a baking sheet and push into a slack oven. They take from six and a half to seven hours to bake. When partly done turn the molds upside down and finish cooking; remove from the oven, lift off the covers and arrange them one beside the other; lay blocks of wood on top, two and a quarter inches thick and of the same dimensions as the opening of the mold, or even slightly narrower, so they can enter the mold with facility. On each block lay a board and on this a sufficiently heavy weight to allow these blocks to enter entirely inside the mold, leaving it in this position for twelve hours in a cool place. Unmold the cakes carefully, wrap them in paper, and range in a hermetically closed tin box. These cakes require to be made two months beforehand, and be left tightly closed so they acquire the mellowness and flavor characteristic of their kind. When needed for use remove from the boxes, take off the paper adhering to the cakes, and cut each ona into even eight crosswise slices; divide all of these on the widest side into five equal-sized pieces, therefore obtaining forty pieces from each mold; wrap each one of these small pieces in a separate piece of waxed paper, then in tin foil, and after all are prepared put them into small cardboard boxes manufactured expressly for this pur- pose, they to be four and three- quarter inches long by an inch and a half wide and an inch and an eighth deep; these are the inside measurements; place on the covers, tie with a white ribbon once around their length and then around their width, forming it into a pretty bow, which must come exactly in the center of the top of the box. For the machine for cutting these cakes see Figs. 596-597. These machines greatly facilitate the cutting. To have them very regular, according to the above proportions, put the whole cake in machine No. 596, cut it in transversal slices one after the other, pressing the cake forward on the machine for each slice that is cut. Machine No. 597 is used for dividing the first slices and to cut them very even, passing the blade of the knife between the vertical guides of the machine. If instead of small cakes in boxes a large one be desired, then put the preparation into one large round mold sixteen inches in diameter at the bottom and eighteen inches at the top or opening; it must be five and a half inches deep and furnished with a tube in the center five and a half inches at the bottom and five at the top. Cover the insides with bands of buttered paper, overlapping each other, and cook the cake the same as the preceding ones in a slack oven, leaving it in from seven to seven and a half hours. Let it get perfectly cold by placing on top a board seventeen inches in diameter, having a hole in the center five and a half inches in diameter, then press down lightly. These cakes ought to be made two months before they are needed and kept in a cool place. When required for use unmold, remove the paper and ice over with several layers of royal icing (No. 101); slide on a board covered with lace paper, and after the icing is perfectly dry decorate with more royal icing. A fine gum-paste vase can be placed in the center, filled with flowers or other orna- ments.","3239":"Butter a pound cake mold and line it with paper. Have one pound of sugar, part of it being flavored with vanilla (No. 3165), in a basin with sixteen whole eggs; whip this till light, warming the preparation over a slow fire.

Then pare it very straight and cover with a layer of apricot marmalade (No. 3675); ice with vanilla fondant (No. 58). After the icing has dried thoroughly slip the cake on a dish and decorate either with royal icing or fanciful cuts of fruits; surround with a circle of preserved plums and cherries.","3240":"Butter well the inside of a baba mold having fluted sides; decorate the interior with halved almonds and keep it cool. Form a hollow in the center of four ounces of sifted flour; in it lay half an ounce of yeast, diluting it little by little with a small quantity of tepid milk; mix both flour and liquid slowly together to obtain a soft paste; gather it all up, lay it on the table and form into a ball, cutting a cross on top; place in a basin, cover with a cloth and leave in a mild tempera- ture to have it rise to double its volume. In another vessel work ten ounces of butter with a spatula to a light cream. Lay three-quarters of a pound of flour in a circle on the table; in the center put one ounce of sugar and a little salt; dissolve these with a little water, then add four whole eggs and four separate yolks; mix the whole well and knead the paste vigorously to have it smooth with plenty of body, proceeding the same as for a baba paste; add slowly a gill and a half of good cream; continue to knead the paste until it is quite glossy, then add the butter slowly, knead once more for a few moments, put in the leaven and mingle all well together, then add four ounces of seeded Malaga raisins. As soon as all the ingredients are perfectly combined lay the paste in the mold to reach to two-thirds of its height and set it in a mild temperature until it raises to the top. Place the mold on a baking pan and bake in a slack oven for two hours; unmold on a wire grate.","3241":"Prepare a fine paste with two eggs, four ounces of almonds and four ounces of hazel-nuts, both well pounded.

Divide this preparation in three rings eight inches in diameter lined with paper; bake the cakes in a slow oven; turn them out as soon as done and leave cool off entirely, then mask each with a thick layer of pastry cream (No. 46) highly flavored with vanilla, adding to it a few roasted hazel- nuts pounded with a little cream. Lay one round on top of the other to form into one large cake; pare it well rounded and very uniform with a knife and cover it entirely with reduced apricot mar- malade (No. 3675); ice the cake with vanilla icing (No. 102). As soon as this is hard and dry slide the cake on a dish covered with lace paper and decorate the top with a fine display of royal icing ornamentation. Surround the bottom of the cake with small lady bouchees (No. 3376) iced with white fondant (No. 58), laying each one in a small paper case.","3242":"Beat up a pound of sugar with fourteen egg-yolks, so as to have it frothy, then add slowly twelve beaten-up whites and at the same time one pound of sifted rice flour, then a pound of melted butter, also pouring it in slowly with some grated lemon peel, a grain of salt, six ounces of candied orange peels cut in small pieces and six ounces of small raisins.

Stand the cake for two or three minutes in the oven to dry the meringue decorations, then take out and fill the cavities with apple, currant and quince jellies and apricot marmalade, alternating the different colors; set it on a lace-paper covered dish. Instead of covering the jelly cake with merin- gue, a piece of cardboard the same diameter as the cake, having a design of any kind cut out to form a stencil, may be used; lay it over the cake, sprinkle it entirely with finely powdered sugar, j-emove the cardboard carefully and the design will be found imprinted on the cake.","3244":"Put fourteen ounces of butter and twenty ounces of sugar in a metal bowl and work together with the hands for fifteen or twenty minutes to have it quite frothy, then add four ounces of almonds, including a few bitter ones, pounded with a little water, and work again for a few moments. Now put in one gill of brandy or rum, twenty ounces of flour and finally twenty very stiffly whipped egg-whites. Butter a pound-cake mold, line it throughout with paper and fill it three-quarters full with the preparation; bake in a very slow oven.

Then ice with royal icing (No. 101) and stand it at once on a lace-paper covered board. After the icing has dried decorate the cake with more royal icing.","3245":"Fasten on a dish a wooden bottom about an inch thick and cover it with white paper. Heat a medium-sized biscuit mold, grease it over with melted veal kidney suet mixed with melted butter, and turn it over to drain out all the fat, then glaze with sugar mixed with fecula. Beat up vigor- ously in a basin twelve egg-yolks with three-quarters of a pound of powdered sugar, having one- quarter of it grated on two mandarins, and add a grain of salt. When this preparation becomes creamy, incorporate into it ten or eleven beaten whites, and at the same time let fall into it through a sieve a pound of fine flour and fecula mixed together; carefully work without breaking, and with it fill the mold nearly to the top; surround the exterior of the top with a band of buttered paper, then lay it on a small baking sheet covered with a thick layer of hot cinders, and push it into a FIG. 598. moderate oven to bake for one hour, carefully turning the baking sheet around at frequent inter- vals. On removing the biscuit from the oven detach it from the top, inserting a small knife around the edges, and unmold on a grate, and when perfectly cold cut the bottom off straight, then let it get stale for seven or eight hours. Should the surface of the biscuit not be smooth, or else too brown, stand it upright on the grate and brush over entirely with apricot marmalade (No. 3675), then cover with raw vanilla icing (No. 102); when this is dry, cut a round piece from the cut side, about a quarter of an inch from the edge, remove this piece and empty out the biscuit as neatly as possible, not approaching the edges too closely. Cut across through the center about twelve small, fresh and sound mandarins; remove the insides neatly from the peel, keeping these as whole as possible, and lay them on one side; suppress the white pith and seeds from the fruit, and crush the pulp to rub it through a sieve; put this into a vessel and mix with it a few spoonfuls of champagne, some syrup, a small bunch of lemon peel and a few spoonfuls of calf's foot jelly (No. 104), sweetened and clarified; let infuse together for fifteen minutes. With a vegetable spoon (Fig. 91) scoop out all the white part from the halved mandarin peels, and incrust them in a thick layer of pounded, slightly salted ice, suppressing the lemon peel from the preparation; thicken it lightly 938 THE EPICUREAN. while stirring on ice, and with it fill the empty peels; brush them over with jelly and keep on ice for a quarter of an hour. Open five or six oranges from the stalk end; with a tin tube empty them out entirely, suppressing all the white pith; incrust them in pounded, unsalted ice, and then fill them with clear jelly flavored with orange (No. 3180), alternated with layers of blanc-mange (No. 3138), also flavored with orange; harden both of these preparations on ice. Now fill the empty biscuit with well-drained and sweetened whipped cream flavored with Curacoa and orange peel. Close the opening with the removed piece and dress on the center of the wooden bottom. Surround with the filled halved mandarins, and the base of the dish with the oranges cut in six, then cut off straight on one end so as to maintain them upright.","3246":"Butter and glaze two dome-shaped pointed molds, seven inches high by six inches in diameter; fill them almost to the top with a lemon-flavored biscuit preparation, the same as for mandarin cakes (No, 3245), and surround the opening with a band of buttered paper; stand them upright on a raised-edge baking sheet and bake the biscuits in a slow oven for one hour.

BAKERY (Boulangerie).","3407":"Bread making is divided into the following operations: The preparation of the stock yeast, the yeast, the ferment, the leaven, the dough, the molding and the baking.","3408":"Boil five quarts of water. Put in a stone jar five ounces of flour; dilute it with a part of this boiling water, sufficient to obtain a very firm paste; put into the remainder of the water one ounce of hops; let boil for ten minutes, then remove the liquid from the fire and run it through a fine sieve into the stone jar and over the paste. Set this jar in a cool place until the liquid is only lukewarm. Then dissolve the paste with the water, and add to it four ounces of malt: cover the pot, and leave it in a rather warm temperature for forty-eight hours, where it cannot be disturbed; when this time has expired strain the liquid through a sieve into another stone jar. The stock yeast is now ready to be used.","3409":"All the utensils used for making yeast and leaven should be kept scrupulously clean, as also the tubs. Put fifteen quarts of water into a large pot; set it on the fire and remove it at the first boil. Lay two pounds of flour in the bottom of a tub, dilute it with a pint of boiling water and make a sufficiently hard paste. Put into the rest of the water in the pot three ounces of hops and?1 let boil for ten minutes, then remove from the fire and strain the boiling liquid at once through a fine sieve into the tub and over the paste; set this tub in a cool place and leave it till the liquid is only lukewarm, then with the hands work the paste well into the water; add immediately one quart of barley malt and a quart of stock yeast, mixing all well together.' Set the tub in a moder- ate temperature and leave without disturbing it while fermenting, which process will take place in eighteen to twenty hours. By attending to these elementary details with care a perfect baking will ensue. Strain the yeast through a fine sieve into another tub and set this in the ice- box, or any cool place, to use as needed for the preparation of the ferment. This yeast will keep perfectly good for four days.","3410":"Wash seventeen quarts of small potatoes, put them into an enameled iron pot, pouring over sufficient cold water to cover; place the pot on the fire, and let them boil uninterruptedly until well done, then remove. Throw the potatoes into a large tub, add two and a half pounds of flour, mash well together with a pestle to reduce the whole to a smooth paste, then dilute this paste gradually with twenty-two quarts of water, either cold or barely lukewarm, according to the tem- perature and season; afterward add five quarts of yeast, and mix the whole well together. Cover the tub with a cloth, and set it in a moderately warm place where there is no danger of its being disturbed and leave it until fermentation takes place, which means until it rises to double its height and falls again to its normal state. The fermentation should take place in from seven to eight hours. With this quantity of ferment a barrel of flour can be used.","3411":"Sift a barrel of flour into one end of the kneading trough; into the other end strain thirty-one quarts of ferment through a colander, and work enough of the flour into it to form a dough, not too consistent; gather up this dough into a small space in the trough and keep it in position with a movable board which answers for a partition; dredge it over with flour, and cover with the lid of the trough, then leave it to rise for three hours; at the end of that time the sponge should be double its size and ready to fall again; it is then ready for the dough.","3412":"Remove the supporting board and let the sponge cover a larger space in the trough; pour over it twenty-nine quarts of water and three pounds of salt dissolved in a part of the water, then mix the whole together until the sponge is well blended; then dredge over the half of the remain- ing flour and knead well together with the hands, giving them a vertical rotary movement, going and coming from one end to the other of the dough; it should now be rather soft and begin to acquire body. Pour the remainder of the flour in one layer over all the paste and knead it once more, but this time cutting it into small pieces with the hands and superposing these pieces at once, one on top of the other; as soon as all the flour is absorbed, then push all of the dough to- one end of the trough. Cut from the whole of it a piece weighing twenty-five pounds; knead it strongly, blowing and beating it forcibly against the sides of the trough, which means to take the piece of dough by the two lateral ends, raise them to the height of the chest, stretching out the dough and bringing it down heavily against the sides of the trough in such a way as to im- prison all the air possible, and give it consistency; repeat the same operation with the remainder of the paste. Superpose the pieces of dough as quickly as they are done, one on top of the other, at the other end of the trough; repeat this operation a second time, then a third and even a fourth time, until the dough has acquired the desired body, then gather it together into a small space in the trough, holding it up with the well-floured board wedged against it. Dredge over lightly with flour, cover and leave it to rise for one hour. The dough is then ready to mold.","3413":"Make a small leaven with four ounces of flour, half an ounce of yeast and sufficient warm milk to form it into a softish paste; mold it into a ball, lay in a vessel, dredge with flour, cover with a cloth and leave it in a mild temperature to raise the leaven to double its size. Sift three- quarters of a pound of flour on the table, form a hollow in the center and in it put a pinch of salt, five ounces of melted butter and half a gill of milk; make the dough of the same consistency as a brioche paste; incorporate the leaven, cutting it up to mix it well with the paste without knead- 973 THE EPICUREAN. ing it. Lay this paste in a vessel, dredge with flour, cover with a cloth and leave it to rise in a mild temperature. Turn it over on the table when it attains twice its original size; cut it up and divide it into pieces; with each of these form a ball an inch and a half in diameter; range them on buttered baking sheets at a distance of an inch and a quarter apart and let rise to double their size; brush over with egg diluted with milk and bake in a moderate oven.","3414":"Make a rather firm leaven with half an ounce of yeast and six ounces of flour; let it rise in a mild temperature. Arrange twelve ounces of flour in a circle, lay a little salt in the center and moisten with a small quantity of milk, adding four ounces of butter; dilute the paste, keeping it rather firm, then add the leaven; when this is well mingled lay the paste in a vessel, cover over and leave to rise slowly, without any heat; after it is well risen cut it up on a floured table and divide it in parts the size of an inch and three-quarters diameter ball; mold each one in a round form and flatten with a roller; spread to a thin oval an eighth of an inch in thickness. With the left hand take hold of the nearest end and with the right roll the opposite end, then bring the two ends quickly together at the same time, being careful to draw the paste lightly with the left hand so as to keep the cake quite thin; this operation should be deftly and speedily performed. As soon as a band is rolled lay it on a baking sheet, ranging it in the shape of a crescent. Leave the paste to rise slowly once more, then wet with a brush dipped in water and push into a hot oven; after removing dampen the tops with f ecu la cooked in water to the consistency of a light syrup, apply- ing it with a brush; this helps to give gloss to the cakes.","3415":"For twelve crowns: Take thirty-six pounds of dough; divide it into twelve parts of three pounds each, and mold all the pieces into separate balls; flatten them to a third of their thickness. Lay these in lightly floured boxes and leave them to rise for half an hour; then remove them from the boxes and lay them on the table, one by one, to flatten out; roll over in four and finally stretch out to the shape of a roll t\\venty-six inches long. As soon as they are done return them to the boxes and leave them to rise for twenty-five to thirty minutes, then take one of them from its box and lay it on the table; with a wooden rolling-pin, as described in the bread-making utensils, split the dough through its whole length without separating it entirely, forming a depression along the center an eighth of an inch in thickness, separating the dough on each side, two and a half inches apart; then take up the furthest edge of the dough, and raising it, bring it_forward toward yourself in such a manner as to partially envelop the other edge of the dough. Bring the two ends together and fasten so as to form a crown. Transfer this into another long box. as explained in No. 3406, covered inside with a piece of coarse linen, laying the split side underneath; continue to mold all the other balls in a like manner, then cover and leave for an hour and a half. As soon as they are sufficiently raised take the round board with a handle, as denoted in No. 3406, in the right hand, and lay it on the right of one of the first molded crowns, slanting it slightly against the crown; at the same time with the left hand take hold of the piece of linen which extends beyond the crown on its left, and with a deft stroke turn the crown over on the board without injuring its shape; transfer this crown on the board and slip it on to the peel, then push it at once into the oven. Continue the same operation for all the other crowns until they are in the oven and leave them there for thirty to thirty-five minutes.","3416":"Lay on the table a part of the dough from the trough; divide it up into pound and a half pieces each and mold them into balls as soon as they are weighed; flatten them down to a third of their thickness, and range them two inches apart in boxes previously bestrewn with flour. When a box is full sprinkle the balls lightly with flour, cover them hermetically by laying another box of the same size on top; fill this one the same as the first, and cover in a similar manner, and con- tinue this process until there are sufficient of them. Over the last box set an empty one and let raise for twenty to twenty-five minutes; take the first ones molded, and with the hands roll and pull them out in a way to give them a cylindrical shape, twenty-two inches long; lay these on a bed of Indian meal previously spread over one end of the table, and leave them there for a few moments — sufficient time to allow the meal to adhere to the dough. Range in a box a long piece of coarse linen, the right end extending up two inches against the side of the box; lay on this piece of linen, against this side, one of the rolls of dough, putting the side the meal is on at the bottom; raise the linen on the left side of the paste in such a manner as to form it into a fold parallel to the roll of dough, to serve as a support, so that the dough when rising does not flatten out, but stands up vertically, which helps to give the bread its round shape. Roll out another roll of dough to form a second roll, the same as the first; lay it in the meal, and then range it on the piece of linen, against the first roll; raise the linen to form a fourth fold to maintain the third roll of dough, and continue the same until the box is full. Cover it hermetically, laying another box on top, and ill it up the same way; when all the balls have been rolled out let them rest for one hour and a half to two hours, according to the temperature and season, or until they rise to a third of their original size. Now take the thin covered board, as explained in bread-making utensils, in the right hand and insert it sideways on the right of the first roll of molded dough, between the fold of linen and the dough; at the same time, with the left hand, take the end of linen on the left of the dough, and hold it so that the dough can be rolled over on this board; transport this roll of paste, and turn it over on the peel; score four slanting incisions at once on its back, using for this the tip of a small knife, and set it into the oven; continue the operation until all the jockos are in the oven, then close it up for fifteen minutes; at the expiration of this time the jockos should be baked. Begin taking out the first ones put in, and continue according to the order they were placed in the oven until all are removed.","3417":"For sixteen pan loaves, two pounds each, lay on the table thirty-two pounds of dough; cut it into sixteen pieces of two pounds each, and mold them into balls; flatten and range them in lightly floured boxes to rise for one-half hour; flatten again and 3ift up the four corners, fold the dough in two, and again in such a way as to form a roll or stick, eight inches long by four inches in diameter; lay these as soon as done in pans sixteen by eight inches with raised edges (No. 3406), previously greased over with lard; lay four in each, very close, one beside the other, and leave them one hour to rise, then push them into a moderate oven to bake for three-quarters of an hour; as soon as they are done remove and turn them out at once. For seven-pound loaves to cut up for sandwiches and croutons, and for twelve-pound loaves for large croustades and bread-crumbs, roll them out, and prepare the same as the two-pound bread, putting seven or twelve pounds of dough into each, according to the size of the mold. Butter or grease the molds, close the lids, and let rise for one hour, then push them into the mild- est spot in the oven. To bake a seven-pound loaf of bread it will take an hour and a quarter; a twelve-pound loaf takes about two hours; when done, remove from the oven and unmold.","3418":"The ingredients are one pound of flour, two eggs, three-quarters of a gill of milk, salt, two ounces of butter, half an ounce each of sugar and yeast. Make a little leaven with a quarter of the flour and the yeast, diluting it with a little warm water; leave this in a vessel, cover and place in a temperate place so that it rises to double its height. Lay the balance of the flour on the table; make a hollow in the center and in this put a pinch of salt, the sugar and a little tepid milk, then the eggs and mix, drawing in the flour gradually and adding the rest of the tepid milk. When all is mixed bring the dough together and knead it well, striking it on the table for a few minutes (the object of this being to incorporate as much air as possible in the paste); when the paste has plenty of body add half the butter to it and continue the kneading until the butter is well worked in, then add the rest of the butter and knead again, working the paste a few minutes longer. Now put in the leaven, mixing it lightly with the dough, set into a vessel, cover with a cloth, and let it rise in a moderate temperature. As soon as this dough is sufficiently raised divide it into pieces of a pound each ; roll out these into ropes half an inch in diameter, and dividing these ropes into twenty equal-sized parts give each one a round shape by rolling them on the table with the palm of the hand; roll them out to the shape of small rolls two and three-quarters inches long, pointed at both ends, and lay them on a slightly buttered baking sheet, keeping them about one inch apart, then leave them to rise in a gentle temperature. As soon as they are sufficiently raised brush them over with beaten eggs twice, and bake in a warm oven. 974 TME EPICUREAN.","3419":"Sift two pounds of flour on the table, divide it into four parts and in one of the quarters form a hollow; set into it an ounce and a half of yeast, diluting with a gill and a half of lukewarm water; work the flour into the liquid in such a way as to obtain a soft leaven; mold it round shape and indent a cross on top; lay it in a vessel into which a few spoonfuls of tepid water have been deposited; cover over and let rise to double its size for twelve to fifteen minutes. During this time range the balance of the flour in a circle, and lay in the center two ounces of sugar, half an ounce of salt, two whole eggs and two and a half gills of barely warm milk; mix the ingredients together, and then incorporate gradually all of the flour; the dough must now be consistent; knead it well and cut it up with the two hands, and beat it on the table for a few moments so that it acquires body; add two ounces of butter and continue kneading for a few minutes longer. As soon as the leaven is ready mix in thoroughly with the dough but without kneading again; lay this in a basin, sprinkle over lightly with flour, cover and let rise for one hour in a mild temperature. At the expiration of that time it should have doubled its original height; knead it once more and divide it into half-pound pieces; divide each into twelve small pieces, obtaining three-quarters of an ounce in each one, then mold these into small balls and set to rise for twenty minutes, after- ward rolling them out with the hand into four and a half inch lengths; range them at once on a lightly buttered baking sheet; when it is full place it in a box and close hermetically; con- tinue to prepare and mold the remainder of the dough, and when all are done examine the first ones that were molded, and should they be sufficiently raised, or increased to a third of their original size, brush them over with beaten eggs and bake in a hot oven. (3420X FLUTES AND SPLIT ROLLS (Flutes et Petits Pains Fendus). Flutes and split rolls are made with a dough slightly stiffer than for the jockos; generally both of these kind of rolls are molded at the same time. Prepare a bread dough as explained before, working it exactly the same, the only difference being it must be kept a little sciffer; let it rise for one hour; knead it again to stop the fermentation and remove it from the trough to the table. Divide it up into two and a half ounce pieces and form them into balls; range these at short dis- tances from each other in slightly floured boxes; set the boxes one on top of the other as fast as they are filled and leave them to rise for fifteen to twenty minutes; at the expiration of this time the balls are ready to be molded into any shape desired. For Flutes or French Rolls. — Lay on the table two of the balls of dough, beginning with those first molded; flatten them down with the palm of the hand, raise the ends of the dough and press these ends together; roll them out on the table with the hands to finish lengthening them, then lay at short distances from each other in boxes lightly dredged with white Indian meal. Continue thus until half of the balls are rolled out. Cover these boxes by setting one on top of the other and leave them to rise for twenty-five to thirty minutes. For Split Rolls. — During the time the flutes are rising split the remainder of the balls of dough. Take six of these balls and range them on the table in rows of two and two, then with a small rolling pin, as described in the article on utensils, split two of them through at the same time; take hold of the edge of the farthest side of each piece and bring it forward; wrap it over half of the front piece so that the molding is on top and the split side underneath, then take these split rolls, one in each hand, and range them against the right side of a box that is already lined with a strip of coarse linen, laying the split side underneath; raise up the linen on the left of the rolls to form a fold which answers for a support, so that while the rolls are rising they cannot fall again. Take six more balls of dough, range them on the table two by two, the same as the first ones; split and lay them on the linen against the others, and continue this operation until all the rolls are shaped. Cover the boxes as fast as they are filled, and leave them to rise for twenty-five to thirty minutes. As soon as all the rolls are split examine the flutes to see whether they are a third larger than when molded; if so they are ready to be placed in the oven; brush them over with beaten eggs diluted in a little water, using a feather brush; take them up delicately with the hands, one by one, and lay them on the peel; cut three slanting incisions on each with the tip of a small knife and place them in the oven. As soon as they are all in, close the oven door for ten to twelve minutes, according to the degree of heat therein; when a fine golden color take them out, beginning with those first put in. By this time the rolls ought to be ready to go in the oven; take them from the linen, six at a time, turning them over on to the board, as described in the bread- making utensils, having the split sides uppermost, removing them exactly the same as the jockos; slide them on the peel, and place them in an oven not too hot; as soon as they are all in close the door for a few minutes, and when done take them out, beginning with those first put in.","3421":"How to Prepare the Dough. — Sift eight pounds of flour into a large wooden bowl; make a hollow in the center and lay in it three ounces of yeast; diluting with three pints of barely luke- warm water, make a soft sponge, sprinkle it over with flour and leave it to rise in a mild tempera- ture for three hours, more or less, according to the heat, and until the sponge doubles itself, then moisten with three pints of milk into which has been dissolved half a pound of sugar and three ounces of salt, incorporating at the same time a pound and a half of butter; knead well and divide it into small pieces. As soon as it is thoroughly mixed incorporate sufficient flour to make a con- sistent dough and knead it well to give it plenty of body. The dough being now finished cut it into three parts. Sweet Rolls. — Put one of these parts into a vessel, sprinkle it lightly with flour and leave it to rise for an hour and a half. Crescents. —Take the second piece of dough, put it into a basin and incorporate four ounces of butter; work well so that it is well mixed, then leave it to rise for one hour and a half. Muffins. — To the third and last piece add a little milk to soften and obtain a mellow dough, keeping it sufficiently firm to be able to mold with the hand on the table; take it out of the bowl, dredge the latter with flour and return the dough to it; besprinkle flour over the top, cover and leave it to rise, the same as the other two, for one hour and a half. At the expiration of this time the three pieces of dough should be raised to double their height. Knead them again to prevent fermentation; they are now ready to be divided and molded. Sweet Rolls. — Begin with the sweet rolls and operate as follows: Break it into two-ounce pieces; roll these into balls and place them as fast as they are done into lightly floured boxes at short dis- tances from each other; dredge slightly with flour, cover and leave them to rise for half an hour, then roll them over again exactly the same as before, giving them a more perfect spherical shape; range these balls as quickly as they are formed into lightly buttered baking sheets with a slight space between each, and as soon as the sheets are filled put them into boxes and cover; let them now rise from one hour to an hour and a quarter; they should be one-third larger than their original size and are then ready to be put into the oven; brush the surfaces with a feather brush dipped in beaten eggs, diluted with a little milk; with a pair of scissors make four deep incisions so as to form a cross, then push them into a slack oven and let bake for eighteen or twenty minutes. Crescents. — Crescents are to be molded in the following manner: Lay on the table the buttered dough already prepared for these; divide it up into one ounce and a half pieces and roll them into balls; set them into the boxes as soon as done, dredge over with rye flour, cover and leave them to rise for thirty-five to forty minutes, then lay two of the first molded balls on the table one beside the other, a short distance apart, and with the roller used for rolls flatten down the two balls at once, to obtain two oval pieces, an eighth of an inch thick, leaving the two furthest sides a little thicker than the forward ones, then with the left hand hold the nearest or front one of these flats, and with the palm of the right hand roll it over on itself, beginning with the back or thick side, and bring it forward to give the shape of a shuttle, six inches long, seven-eighths of an inch in the center and one-fourth of an inch at the ends; lay them when finished on a lightly buttered baking sheet, giving them the shape of a crescent, and finish the other oval layer the same, continuing until all the balls are molded; as fast as each baking sheet is filled put them into the boxes, cover and leave for one hour to one hour and a quarter; brush over with beaten eggs diluted in a little milk and push them into a slow oven to bake for twelve to fifteen minutes. Muffins. —Lightly butter three dozen tin muffin rings three and a half inches across and one inch high; lay them on two lightly buttered baking sheets. Place the third piece of dough — the one softened with milk — on the table, cut it into an ounce and three-quarters pieces ana roll them all into balls; flatten slightly in the middle and lay them at once into the rings; when all are filled cover over with two more lightly buttered baking sheets, set a weight on top of each and leave the 976 THK EPICUREAN. dough rise for three-quarters of an hour; push them gently into the oven, sheets, weights ?,nd all, being careful not to disturb them whatever; they take from twenty to twenty-five minutes to bake; turn them out of the rings as soon as they leave the oven.","3422":"Put four ounces of butter into a tin basin; work it to a cream with four ounces of sugar, add a pinch of salt and four eggs singly, also a gill of milk; now sift in one pound of corn flour and half a pound of ordinary flour into which has been previously added two coffeespoonfuls of baking- powder, and add another gill of milk to finish. Butter some corn bread molds, fill them three- quarters full with the preparation, lay them on baking-sheets and set them in a hot oven to bake for twelve to fifteen minutes; unmold them as quickly as they are done and removed.","3423":"The dough for rye bread is made exactly as for ordinary bread (see the article on bread dough), the only difference being that half rye and half wheat flour are used; a few caraway seeds may be added to the dough, mixing them in when the kneading process begins. When the dough is finished and sufficiently raised, cut it into two-pound pieces, turn and roll them out long-shaped and lay them in the folds of linen exactly the same as the jockos. Just when ready to put into the oven, while still on the peel, dampen the tops with water, using a brush, and cut a few slanting incisions on each one with the tip of a small knife, then set them in the oven to bake for forty-five minutes. Boston Brown Bread. — Place in a basin two and three-quarter pounds of yellow corn meal, two pounds of white corn meal, one and three-quarter pounds of rye flour, one pound of Boston meal and an ounce of salt. Dilute these flours with one pint of New Orleans molasses, one pint of Potter molasses, one quart of ferment (No. 3410), and two quarts of water; mix all well together, making a very soft paste, then cover over and leave it in a mild temperature to raise for four hours. Then add three-quarters of an ounce of soda dissolved in a glassful of water and twelve ounces of stale bread sifted through a sieve; mingle all well together. With this paste fill three-quarters full some buttered timbale molds and leave the paste stand for one hour. Cover over and place in a very slow oven and let bake for six hours. Graham Bread. — Put into a large vessel one and a quarter pounds of wheat flour, one and a quarter pounds of Graham flour, a coffieespoonful of salt and half a gill of molasses. Onto these ingredients pour one and a quarter pints of leaven, and one and a quarter pints of water. Mix all well together forming a dough of the same consistence as for bread; cover and leave it to raise for two hours in a mild temperature. Divide the dough into pound and a quarter pieces, mold and place each one in buttered molds; let raise again for an hour and a half to two hours, then bake in a very slack oven. Graham flour is made of the wheat ground to flour and left unsifted, consequently it contains the bran and commoner qualities than other flours. ICES (Glaces),","3425":"Have a machine of basin or pear shape. The basin-shaped machine should be fifteen inches in diameter by fifteen inches in height and rounded at the bottom, to be provided with a tinned iron rod running through the freezer and fitting into a gear with a pivot below (see Fig. 611). Put the cover on the freezer and pack it in salted ice; remove the cover and pour into the freezer (which contains about thirty quarts), six quarts of preparation, or the fifth part of its capacity. FIG. 611. Turn the freezer by hand or by steam and detach the composition as fast as it adheres to the sides. As soon as the cream is sufficiently consistent, transfer it to a long freezer packed in salted ice (see how to pack in ice, No. 3432). Several compositions can be frozen one after the other without washing out the freezer, by beginning to freeze the composition containing the least color, and being careful to remove any particles of cream remaining after the operation is finished. (3426). HOW TO COOK THE CREAM FOR ICES (Maniere de Ouire les Oremes pour les Glaces) First boil the milk or cream. If with vanilla or white coffee infuse either of these into the milk or cream. Put the yolks or whites of eggs in a tinned basin of sufficient size not to have the mixture rise to over three-quarters of the height of the vessel; add sugar to the yolks or whites, beating it in well with a whisk; then add the boiling milk or cream. Set the basin on a slow fire or in a bain-marie; stir continuously with the spatula until the composition be of a sufficient thick- ness to cover this spatula, which will occur a few moments before it begins to boil; remove it from the fire or bain-marie and then strain through a Venice or plated copper wire sieve; stir occasion- ally while cooling and freeze when thoroughly cold. For cooked ice cream be careful to select only the freshest eggs and milk; the most important point to be observed in these creams is to have the eggs cooked, allowing them to proceed as far as possible without actually boiling, then pour quickly through a sieve and stir steadily until most of the heat is lost.","3427":"Procure a tin freezer with a tinned copper bottom, in preference to all others, or else one of block tin; also a wooden pail deeper than the freezer; this pail, made expressly for freezing purposes, must be bored with two holes; one two inches above the bottom and another an inch and a half below the top of the freezer. Close these holes with well-fitting corks that can easily be removed. Put at the bottom of the pail a flat piece of ice about four inches thick — this is to facilitate the rotary movement of the freezer — lay the freezer exactly in the center and pack it around with ice. as des- cribed in No. 3432; now lift off the cover, pour in, to a third of its height, the prepared composition needed for freezing, turn the freezer rapidly by its handle to the right and then to the left, and as soon as the ice attaches to the sides detach it by sliding the spatula or palette along the sides of the freezer from the top as far down as the bottom. Cover the freezer, turn and detach again and repeat the same operation until the cream is found to be of 980 THE EPICUREAN. a sufficient consistency, then finish freezing and have it acquire body, while working vigorously with the spatula, giving the freezer a rotary movement at each turn with the spatula. If the cream cannot be finished without repacking the freezer, then let a little of the water run out and repack it once more.","3428":"To accomplish this it will be necessary to have a wide and not very deep freezer; pack it in a pail of sufficient size to allow three inches of ice all around; add a little salted water to the ice so as to loosen the freezer before beginning the operation. The inside measurements of the pail should be sixteen inches deep and sixteen inches in diameter, so that when the freezer is packed it will be on a level with the pail. Pour two or three quarts of the composition into the freezer, put on the lid and turn it to the right and left until the movement becomes easy to perform. Lift off the cover; take hold of the edge of the freezer between the thumb and first finger and with the palm of the right hand give it a continuous rotary movement, detaching the ice as fast as it adheres to the sides, and continue the operation until FIG. 616. the preparation has congealed sufficiently; then transfer it to another freezer packed beforehand in ice, putting only a little in at a time; in this way it is easier to work and the ices become much finer.","3429":"Have a machine with two or three pails and freezers of various sizes, according to require- ments (for this see design, Fig. 617). Proportions for a machine containing eighteen quarts and for one containing twelve: Put the composition into the freezer packed in the pail, not having it reach above half the height of the freezer; in the center stand the detaching apparatus, intended for the purpose of detaching the cream from the sides — this turns one way and the freezer itself in the opposite direction; in this manner it detaches the cream from the sides, making it much lighter. Put the cover on the detaching apparatus and turn the freezer for ten minutes, either by steam or hand. After the cream is congealed take the spatula and detach any cream adhering to it. Should it have to remain in the same freezer, pack it once more in ice (No. 3432). Proportions for an eighteen-quart freezer: The inside pail is twenty-four inches high; diameter across the opening thirteen and a half inches; diameter across the bottom twelve inches. Either size should be made of oak an inch thick. The freezer for this pail must be nineteen and a half inches high by eight inches in diameter. For the inside measurements of a twelve-quart freezer, have the height of the pail twenty-one inches by thirteen inches in diameter at the opening, the bottom to be eleven and a half inches. The freezer for this pail must measure eighteen and a half inches in height and seven and a half in diameter.","3430":"Have a tin freezer (sorbetiere) capable of holding sixteen quarts of preparation ; imbed it in salted ice, and pour into it eight quarts of composition, then turn the freezer from right to left, and as soon as it becomes easy to turn seize the edges between the thumb and first finger of the right hand, and move it with a continuous motion. After a suffi- cient quantity of ice adheres, remove it with a copper spoon (Fig. FlQ 61g 618), to detach it from bottom to top. Another tin freezer must be imbedded beforehand. Put into this second freezer the ice taken from the first; another person must now work this ice until it becomes perfectly smooth, and then transfer it once more into a third freezer, packed in salted ice, to preserve it. Ices made this way are remarkably smooth, and can be molded at once.","3431":"(Maniere de Mouler, Trapper et DSmouler les Petites Glaces et les Grosses Pieces Kepre'sentant des Sujets). To mold ices representing any object or subject whatsoever calls for the greatest amount of care, otherwise a defective result will ensue. When small ices or half ices are required for molding, such as those representing flowers, fruits, etc., lay the molds on unsalted ice so they become thoroughly cold. Cover the bottom of a pail with a layer of salted ice, having a sufficient quantity of it to form a bed three inches deep; then take the mold in the left hand and in the right a copper spoon (Fig. 618, a Neapolitan spoon), this being used to take up the various ices meant for filling the molds. It should be kept continually in water so as to keep it clean, as it is us^d for different creams. Press down the composition without inclosing any air between the mold and the ice; in this way it can adhere to the various designs imprinted on the mold, leaving no empty space whatever between. Now, having the mold full, close it forcibly, bringing the cover down well on to it, and with the finger remove any surplus ice that may issue from the intersections of the mold. After it is pressed down stand it on a bed of prepared salted ice and over lay more of the same ice. Continue thus to mold and pack down until all the molds are finished, then cover the whole with ice and salt; leave to freeze for one hour or more, according to the composition used, the size of the mold, and also according to the humidity of the atmosphere. When it becomes a question of molding more important ices, such as figures, subjects, etc., after cooling the molds thoroughly lay them on a slightly raised bed of rice and salt, so that they can be filled cautiously and with facility, for it requires every possible precaution in order to form these figures properly. Close the mold furnished with pins. After filling it well, beginning from the bottom put on the lid and press it down forcibly, removing any surplus ice issuing from the joints, and pack the mold in plenty of salted ice (No. 3432), leaving it in as long as judged proper, a two-quart mold requiring about two hours. To Unmold. — Take the mold out of the ice, remove any surplus ice on the outside, and the pins from the hinges, then plunge the mold thoroughly and hastily in hot water; lift off the cover and lay the fancy ice mold bottom downward on a napkin; detach all the parts quickly but cau- tiously from the mold so as not to deform the piece. Those of a larger size are usually dressed on colored natural ice socles; these ices may be painted over with small badger brushes dipped in vegetal colors into which a little syrup has been mixed. The base of the molds intended to stand on socles should be of ice cream and not too rich, as they support the weight of the whole piece. When packed in ice the base of the mold should always be at the bottom of the pail; cover this with a cloth, packing it down well between the ice and pail.","3432":"Salt and saltpetre are the active agents used for freezing. The quantity employed is one pound of salt for four pounds of ice, this being a pro- portionately active mixture for freezing the very richest cream and water ices. The salt and ice can be ranged in alternate layers or else have the whole mixed well together in a pail; in either case place ice around the freezer and pack it down well with the palette. Repeat this operation every time more salted ice is to be packed. Always pay attention that sorbetieres turned by hand are to be packed lower than the edge of the pail, so that when the ice is finished the cover of the freezer may be adjusted as well as the cover on the pail. In houses where ices are being constantly made they have boxes lined with galvanized sheet-iron cylinders, and the empty space between the box and the cylinder is filled either FIG. 619. with charcoal dust, tow or sawdust, as well as the covers; each cylinder must be provided with a hole one inch in diameter and two inches from the bottom to allow the water to run out. In case the water should not be allowed to flow off, then it will be prudent to bore a hole half an inch in diameter, one inch lower than the height of the freezer.","3433":"Water bottles are easily frozen, only be careful to follow closely the ensuing instructions. If a handsome looking bottle is required, it must be of a spherical shape, slightly longer than its 982 THE EPICUREAN. width and of ordinary thick glass; it must invariably be clean, and then filled slightly less than half full or a little lower than the circumference line of the sphere, with filtered water. Mix three- quarters of very finely chopped ice with one-quarter of rock salt; range the bottles in a box suffi- ciently large to hold twenty, leaving an inch space between each; cover the neck of the bottle with a tinned copper cup, having a round bottom, or else with a specially made rubber cork (Fig. 620); cover entirely with salted ice, raising them all up so that the ice passes slightly underneath each bottle; neglect of this precaution will break all the bottles in the box. Pack the ice around, cover the box with a hermetically closed cover, and an hour later raise up the bottles, one by one, and give each a rotary movement to hasten the freezing; withdraw all the superfluous water above two-thirds of the height of the ball of the bottle, and leave in again for an hour and a half to finish freezing; remove the faucet that keeps the water in the box, let this run out, and besides remove the corks from the necks of the bottles; when ready to serve lift them out, wash in cold water and fill with filtered ice water.","3434":"Procure a box sufficiently wide and deep to contain all the molds needed for making the socles and sherbets; into it put a mixture of ^itil sa^ an<* 'ce ecluivalent to tne quantity used for packing freezers; into this imbed the molds in such a way that they are not too close FlG. 620. to one another, having all their sides well surrounded by the ice, so that when the water is poured into these molds their surfaces will be perfectly horizontal; for this examine the basket shown in Fig. 621. The mold for this basket is made in two pieces; imbed the bottom or foot in the salted ice; into it pour water colored green or blue and as the foot is to be of uniform tint fill it entirely, then leave to freeze. Now place the upper part of the mold in salted ice, pour in water to reach halfway, having mixed a little milk into it to render it opaque. Cover the box with a raised edge sheet of zinc and fill this with more salted ice and let freeze. As soon as the whitened water is frozen fill the remainder of the mold with red water. These colored waters should be used perfectly cold and the last ones poured in only after the first ones are congealed. The colors may be varied accord- ing to the taste of the one preparing the socles and glasses. It is most important to remember that no salted water whatever must penetrate into the molds, otherwise it will melt and eat away the ice already congealed and deteriorate FIG. 621. the beauty of these socles and glasses. The unmolding is the same as for ices. Socles are to be dressed on folded napkins and glasses on lace papers. Ices can also be dressed on blocks of ice cut any desired size and shape. To keep these blocks together, iron rods can be procured, having on one end a sheet iron ring and on the other a nut screw to hold the whole together. These rods are to be inserted in a hole through the center of the socle formed with a tube foot in the center of the mold and held in place with butter, being cai-eful to have it water-tight, so the liquid cannot penetrate. They can be decorated with grasses and flowers maintained by wires introduced into the water when it first begins to congeal. Blocks of all sizes can be made in square, oblong, round or oval molds, having a hollow formed in the middle; for these special molds must be procured.","3435":"To make these biscuits use a vanilla biscuit preparation (No. 3438), or else vanilla ice cream (No. 3458) beaten in a metal bowl with as much whipped cream mixed with it. Cut candied fruits into three-sixteenths inch squares, lay them in a bowl, pour over a little kirsch and let soak while cov- ered, adding a few crushed macaroons. Fill the cases half full with the preparation, lay a bed of the fruits and macaroons on top and then another layer of the cream, filling the cases to one-eighth of an inch below the edge of the box. Freeze the biscuits and cover with a layer of whipped cream tinted rose-pink, mixing in a pinch of ground cinnamon; return the biscuits to the freezing box and finish freezing. Biscuit Cases. — Boxes for biscuit glaces are made with sheets of very strong paper, generally a little longer than their width, being six and a half inches long and six inches wide. In order to make these boxes take one of these sheets of paper and fold it lengthwise on itself in three even parts; again refold the two lateral parts on themselves lengthwise on the outside, thus forming a long band open in the center. These last two folds form the double lateral edges of the box. Again fold this band transversely on the open side into three parts, but in such a way that the two extreme ends exactly meet at the center of the band. Open all the folds except the two forming the outside edges of the box, and when this is done there will be found traced on the paper the various lines representing the bottom, the center and the four sides, besides four small rectangular corners which are used for closing the box. Fold each of these four rectangulars all on the inside so as to trace on each one an almost diagonal line beginning at the bottom angle of the box. Now, by fol- lowing the lines of these folds, raise the lateral sides of the box, also the ends, at a straight angle with the bottom; by folding the small rectangulars at the almost diagonally traced line the result will be the angles of the box by the junction of the prolonged lines traced on the bottom of the box; then bring the two wings of each end, which are exteriorly against and in the center of the small edges, or ends, of the box. Fold outward the corners of the two ends, exceeding the edges of the box so as to form two truncated triangles; fold over these triangles on the outside against the nar- row ends of the box and seal them down. Another Way to Make Biscuit Cases. — Take a quarter of a sheet of strong white paper; cut it about twice as long as its width, so as to give it an oblong shape. Fold this paper lengthwise in three on its length, then refold the two sides on themselves on the outside so as to double them, and thus form a long, straight band, open on one side only; fold the double points of the angles inwardly again so as to have the band pointed on each end; now fold these two ends on the inner side, simply to form the fold, open the band, press the folds well and the box will be formed. The narrow sides of the band form the length of the case.","3436":"Have ready a vanilla biscuit preparation (No. 3438), line a large biscuit case, the size being explained in the vanilla biscuit recipes; fill it half full with the preparation.

Vanilla Strateberry Turban can be made by mixing in the same quantity of whipped cream (No. 50) after it is frozen; unmold and garnish the center with fresh strawberries macerated in kirsch, maraschino and a little powdered sugar. The turban can also be served plain or else trimmed with a sultana of spun sugar.","3601":"The base of all water ices is the pulp or juice of fruits, with sugar syrup prepared beforehand at thirty-two degrees, or else substitute a pound and a half of sugar for each quart of water. The syrup gauge (Fig. 167) is the only arbiter for ascertaining the proper degree; they can be prepared from fourteen to twenty-four degrees. At eighteen degrees a thin ice is obtained called granite. Eighteen to nineteen degrees is an excellent degree for water ices prepared for the taste of this country, although in some climates they are made as high as twenty-four degrees. At this degree very fine and consistent ices are formed, but they are objectionably sweet and therefore not, generally liked, so that water ices at eighteen to twenty degrees are considered the best — eighteen degrees with fruit pulps and twenty degrees for fruit juices, or sometimes twenty-two, according to the acidity of the fruit. The juice of three lemons make about a gill; for this quan- tity use two pounds and a quarter of sugar and one pint of water, obtaining a quart of syrup at thirty-degrees. To freeze the fruit preparation it requires two freezers, one of a high shape and the other semi-spherical. Before freezing the mixture in the semi-spherical freezer it must be packed in salted ice and the inside wiped out neatly, then pour in about a gill of the preparation to try its consistency, working it with a small spatula, and if found to be sufficiently congealed pour in about two quarts to freeze, setting the semi-spherical freezer in motion and detaching at times with the spatula any particles that may adhere to the sides. As soon as the ice attains a proper consistency remove and lay it in a small, long sorbetiere (freezer) also imbedded in salted ice. The ice should be worked vigorously with the spatula to have it acquire body, then imbed it once more, letting all the superfluous water run out of the hole at the bottom of the pail, adding more salted ice, packing it down with a stick; cover the pail with a lid or a cloth to prevent any air from entering and keep it thus until ready for use.","3602":"Por Peaches, Apricots, Nectarines. — Select good fresh plucked fruits, yet not too ripe; split open, suppress the stalks, pith and skins; cut up finely and bestrew with vanilla sugar to hinder from blackening, then strain through a fine sieve. Put the pulp in a vessel and mix in a pint of thirty-two degree syrup for each quart, the juice of two oranges and four lemons and a bit of orange peel. Strain this preparation through a silk sieve and freeze it. As soon as the ice con- geals remove with a spoon and place in a small, long freezer packed in ice; work it vigorously for ten minutes, incorporating slowly a pint of Italian meringue (No. 140) for each quart of syrup, and half a gill of kirsch or noyau; work it again ten minutes to have it smooth. For Cherries, Pomegranates, Currants and Barberries. — A pint of fruit pulp for one quart of syrup and one gill or the juice of three lemons. If with cherries, crack the pips to extract and crush the meat and make the syrup of twenty degrees strength. For currants use the juice of two lemons; color with vegetal red, strain through a silk sieve and freeze.","3603":"Select fruits that are ripe, having them in preference a little too hard than too soft; they must be fragrant and freshly plucked. Suppress the skins or peels with a knife; press first through a sieve, then through a tammy; put the puree in a vessel, allowing for each quart one pint of cold syrup, the juice of two oranges and four lemons and the peel of half an orange infused in a gill of syrup. Stir all the ingredients well together and bring it to a twenty to twenty-two degree syrup; strain through a very fine Venice or silk sieve and pour into a semi-spherical freezer: allow it to congeal without ceasing to detach with a large spatula every particle adhering to the sides of the freezer. As soon as the ice is all congealed remove it with a spoon and transfer to a small, long 1036 TH^ EPICURE AN. freezer imbedded in salted ice to have it acquire plenty of body, and smooth while still stirring; lastly incorporate three tablespoonfuls of good rum, kirsch or prunelle, mixed with a little of the syrup and frozen preparation, being careful to incorporate it little by little; work again for a few moments, freeze once more and serve.","3604":"Pour into a vessel some syrup made with two and a quarter pounds of sugar and a pint of water cooked to thirty-two degrees; cool off, then add two gills or the juice of six lemons and the peel of four of the finest among them well washed and wiped; let the preparation attain twenty degrees according to the syrup gauge and infuse therein the peels, leaving them for two hours; strain through a silk sieve and freeze. Another Way. — Proportions: Four pounds of sugar, three gills of water, the peel of fifteen lemons and the juice of twenty-five; cook to twenty degrees of the syrup gauge; infuse the peels in this for two hours; strain the whole through a silk sieve and freeze. This quantity will produce a little more than six quarts. Grape Fruit.— Prepare this ice the same as lemon water ice, substituting grape fruit for lemons.","3605":"Take one quart of syrup at thirty-two degrees, five gills of orange juice, the peel of a large orange and one gill of lemon juice. Infuse for two hours, bring it to eighteen or twenty degrees of the syrup gauge, and color with a little carmine; strain through a silk sieve and freeze. Another Way. — Six pounds of sugar, four quarts of water, thirty oranges, using the peel of six- teen, and the juice of twelve lemons. Infuse for two hours, bring to twenty degrees, strain through a silk sieve and freeze. This will make about eight quarts. With Gelatine. — Have one quart of water, one pound of sugar, the peel and juice of two oranges, the juice of four lemons, a sheet of gelatine weighing a quarter of an ounce, previously dissolved in a little water, then strained through a fine sieve. The ice may be flavored with ex- tract of orange and the lemon replaced by citric acid.","3606":"Pineapple can be prepared in two ways, eithel grated or pounded in a mortar or infused in a syrup. Infused in Syrup. — Boil a quart of thirty-two degi'ee syrup, add to it one pound of peeled pineapple cut in thin slices, also the peel of one orange; remove from the fire, cover the saucepan, and leave to cool in the syrup, adding one gill or the juice of three lemons; strain forcibly, either through a Venice sieve or a silken one; boil the mixture until it reaches twenty degrees of the syrup gauge and freeze. Another way is to place a pound of sugar in a vessel with two quarts of water and one quart of grated or crushed pineapple; let infuse for two hours; add a leaf and a naif of isinglass dissolved in half a pint of water acidulated with the juice of eight lemons or else melted citric acid; strain through a fine sieve and freeze. Another Way. — One quart of grated pineapple, two pounds of sugar, two quarts of water, the juice of sixteen lemons or five gills. Finish the same as water ice (No. 3601).","3607":"Small ripe wild berries are preferable to cultivated ones for these ices. Put one quart of strawberry or raspberry pulp in a basin, and dilute with a pint and a half of cold syrup at thirty degrees; add a little vanilla, the peel of an orange, the juice of two oranges and of four lemons; strain through a silk sieve. The syrup should be from twenty to twenty-two degrees. Another Way. — Take eight pounds of powdered sugar, two quarts of fruit pulp, the juice of twenty lemons and six quarts of water; color to a light red with vegetal carmine. Bring it to twenty degrees of the syrup gauge, strain through a silk sieve and freeze. ICED DEINKS,","3608":"Dissolve a pound of sweet chocolate in a quart of water with half a bean of vanilla; when cold stir in a quart of cream, then strain through a fine sieve. Another way is to take a pound of sweet chocolate, half a pint of water and half a vanilla bean; when the chocolate is all dissolved and cold mix into it three pints of cream and a gill of thirty-two degree syrup; strain through a sieve and put it into a freezer with lightly salted ice around, and serve in glasses.","3609":"GRAMOLATES OR GRANITE WITH ORANGE (Gramolates on Granit a 1'Orange), Put in a vessel one quart of fifteen-degree syrup, the juice and peels of three oranges; cover over and leave infuse for one hour; add the juice of four lemons and a little orange vegetal car- mine; strain through a silk sieve and freeze. Peel three oranges to the pulp, remove the pulp by passing the knife near each section and lay the pieces in a bowl with a very little sugar andkirsch; steep for half an hour then add it to the ice and serve in glasses.","3611":"Granites are made the same as water ices, flavored with any desired fruits, the sole difference being that they must not be worked and must only attain fourteen degrees of the saccharometer; when the composition is ready pour it in water bottles having very wide necks; pack these in ice with half as much salt as for ordinary ices. Detach from the sides with a small boxwood spatula. Serve in the same decanters or else in glasses.","3612":"The grape fruit is a species of large yellow orange, resembling the Florida orange; it is slightly bitter. Select those that are not too large, cut them across in two, empty the insides, keeping it all in a vessel, and notch the edges of the peel in points; remove the small rounds from the center and then place them to cool in a freezing-box. Prepare a mixture the same as orange punch, Russian style (No. 3613), the only difference to observe being that all the fruit juice must be used; bring to twelve degrees and let cool to a granite (No. 3611), then serve in the prepared peels. 1028 THE EPICUREAN.","3613":"Slit open with a tin tube an inch and a half in diameter the top of eight oranges on the side opposite to the stalk, empty them out entirely, wipe neatly and set them in low paper cases to keep them level. On the round piece removed from the orange fasten two long straws, tying them together with a ribbon passed through two holes. Put these oranges for at least two hours beforehand in a box and pack with ice and very little salt, not to freeze the rinds. Place in a freezer one pint of orange juice obtained from the pulp of the emptied oranges and strained through a fine strainer, add to it two gills of water, six ounces of sugar, a gill of rum, half a gill of kirsch, the peel of two oranges and the juice of four lemons; flavor it properly, either by adding or removing any of the ingredients; strain the whole through a very fine silk sieve and freeze with ice and a little salt. Just when ready to serve fill the oranges and serve them at once. The straws are used for drinking the contents of the orange. Fig. 727. (Oonfiserie).","3614":"Confectionery encompasses the art of sugar work, nougat, marzipan, pulled sugar, spun sugar, gum paste, and decorative centerpieces. It requires great skill and artistry, combining technical precision with aesthetic creativity.","3615":"Centerpieces representing figures from commerce, science, animals, trees and flowers require great talent. The art of making decorative sugar pieces is certain to become fashionable; authors of the best works on cooking and pastry concur that this branch of confectionery deserves wider practice.","3616":"For cooked sugar see Elementary Methods (No. 171). It is always necessary to have sugar cooked in advance so that each time some is wanted it will not have to be prepared, especially when only a little is to be used at a time. Have some sugar cooked to \"large crack\" (No. 171); when it reaches three hundred and thirty degrees add to it the juice of a quarter of a lemon and leave cook to three hundred and fifty degrees, then pour it hastily on a FIG. 732. thick marble sufficiently large to allow it to cool, then detach and set it away in hermetically closed tin boxes. To make web or spun sugar, first melt it slowly in a small copper pan, a little at a time, being careful it does not change color. This sugar is used for spinning sultanas, for making ornaments in spun sugar, or it can be used for Parisian nougat and even for candy- ing fruits, reducing its degree by introducing a little syrup at thirty-two degrees or else some glucose. For spun sugar pieces lightly trace with a pencil on an unpolished and very lightly oiled marble the outlines of the design needed for reproduction; cover this tracing with a thread of firm royal icing, either large or small according to the size of the piece. Fill in between these threads of icing with melted sugar, white or colored; detach the piece from the marble before it is thoroughly cold, as then they are apt to break easily. Instead of using royal icing the tracing can be outlined with a thread of spin- ning sugar of a different color from that used in the inside; put all the pieces together, attaching them in four, six, or eight, and ornament them here and there, when fastened, according to taste, with candied fruits, bonbons, or else small cakes, almond paste, etc. ; decorate with flowers or leaves made of FIG. 733. sugar molded in oiled tin molds, dipped in sugar cooked to \"crack,\" lightly cooled in its pan, then hung by a wire to hooks slightly apart so they cannot touch one another. Unmold as soon as they begin to cool and place on grates until ready for use. Sheaves can also be made (an imitation of sheaves of rye or wheat) in very finely drawn sugar, fastened with an imitation band prepared with the same sugar. These sheaves may be colored or white, according to the taste; the sugar should be cooked to three hundred and thirty-five degrees. Pieces may also be decorated with pulled sugar flowers.","3617":"Pyramids made of spun sugar or nougat can be kept in a perfect state of preservation by standing them under a plain glass globe to protect them from the action of the air. But should it be necessary to keep them for several days, then they must certainly be placed under a glass globe fitting on to a hollow wooden stand opening on the top, having its surface bored with holes and the empty space filled in with bits of quicklime. The lime has the faculty of absorbing all the humidity of the atmosphere; in this way sugar can be kept intact for an indefinite period, especially in winter time and damp weather. Pieces made of royal icing or gum paste can also be kept for a long while if the above method be followed. 1032 THE","3618":"Among the various objects that can be made of pulled sugar must be mentioned flowers and all kinds of leaves, which with a little taste and skill can be beautifully imitated, and if this branch FIG. 735. FIG. 736. FIG. 737. of decoration is studied it can become one of artistic merit. At the beginning learners should not undertake the task of making difficult flowers, such as roses, dahlias, or other flowers having numerous petals, but must be satisfied with more simple ones, such as apple blossoms, wild roses, poppies, pansies, etc. Cook the sugar to \"large crack \"(No. 171), or 335 degrees Fahrenheit, being careful to have it very clear, transparent and grainless. Let it get cold on a marble slab. Melt a pound of this sugar in a copper pan, keeping it as white as possible. Pour a tablespoonful of the syrup on the marble, and add to it the color- ing matter for the intended flowers; pound the color should it be dry; then pour over the melted sugar, and work the whole together with a spatula, and afterward with the hand until it becomes smooth and tractable. Put this pulled sugar into a mold, or on a lightly oiled dish, and then in a heater which should regis- ter 170 degrees Fahrenheit. It will be enough for us to explain the making of just a few kinds of flowers, in order that the work for all others may be understood. For in- stance, we will begin with a cluster of apple blossoms: Take from the heater a small quantity of very white pulled sugar, and dipping the finger in corn starch to prevent them sticking to the sugar make some petals as shown in Fig. 735, pressing it down between the thumb and first finger as thinly as possible, and detaching it with a pair of scissors as fast and as soon as it is pressed into shape, varying the shapes BO that when finished they are not all alike. Use the flame of a small gas stove to keep the sugar soft; now heat the bottom of each petal over this gas flame, and adjust five of them togther to form each separate flower (Fig. 736). Make also buds and partly opened flowers. Color a little gum paste a bright yellow with a small wooden or bone tool, and form the inside. Paint the edges of the petals a pale pinkj FIG. 738. FIG. 739. FIG. 740. FIG. 741. CONFECTIONERY. 1033 also the buds, being careful to use the coloring matter as dry as possible. Now color a little of the pulled sugar green and form the leaves the same way as the flowers, afterward pressing them on a lightly oiled plaster mold to mark the veins (Fig. 740, No. 3). Melt all the fragments of the various colored pulled sugars, and add to it some cocoa, and with it coat various lengths of wire; twist them to resemble branches of trees, and stick them together (Fig. 740, No. 4), and on it mount the flowers and buds (Fig. 741). Proceed exactly the same for all petal flowers, such as leaves, roses, violets, tulips, poppies and pansies (see Fig. 737, No. 7, for the pansies). The bunch of apple blossoms, if well made, is most natural. For calla lilies the operation is entirely different. Leave the sugar, pulled very white, in the heater until it runs slightly. The principal object is to work it quickly. Take a small piece from the heater, the size of a walnut, and roll it with the rolling-pin on marble as thinly as possible, always using corn starch for the roller and fingers. Cut the sugar rapidly with the scissors into pieces the shape of leaves, having the bottom part pulled out lengthways; heating these over the gas, should the sugar get too cold (Fig. 738, No. 8), bend them into cornets (Fig. 738, No. 9), always while heating, and fold the edges outward (Fig. 738, No. 10). Color a little sugar a bright yellow, and make the inside of the flower. Coat it lightly with gum arable, and roll it in powdered sugar that has already been tinted to a fine yellow. Leaves are made the same way; roll them out with the roller, cut them into long shapes, and press on a plaster mold to mark the veins. Mount the flowers and leaves on stalks of wire covered with green sugar (Fig. 739). The principal thing to be observed when making any object, either of sugar or nougat, is to perform the work as speedily as possible, for the less the pulled sugar is heated at the gas flame the more beautiful and brilliant it will remain, and its glossy luster will not be marred. Satinated Pulled Sugar.— Place three and a half pounds of lump sugar in an untinned copper pan and moistening with one quart of lukewarm water, leave soak for a few moments. Cook it on a brisk fire, skim and wash the same as for caramel and after a few boils add a heaping coffee- spoonful of cream of tartar. Let the sugar attain three hundred degrees, then pour it on to a very cold, slightly oiled marble. When sufficiently cold to allow it to be handled mass it all together and pull it slowly, then mass again with the palm of the hand; pull it again a little, just sufficient to give it a clouded appearance. Put it in the heater and use small quantities, according to the work to be done, pulling and massing to givp it a brilliant surface. Never use this sugar when too hot, on the contrary work it as cold as possible so that it will not lose its brilliancy. Flowers, leaves, baskets, etc., can be made with satinated sugar.","3619":"Macaroons, candied fruits, small cakes, bonbons, meringues or marchpanes fastened together and applied on conical-shaped molds, having their base measuring eight to ten inches in diameter, and ending in a point one inch in diameter; this style of piece is not much used nowadays except in ordinary balls or banquets. It is gum paste, nougat, royal icing and cooked sugar that the prettiest pieces are made of, and in these the true artist can be readily distinguished.","3620":"Prepare a cooked almond paste the same as explained in the Elementary Methods (No. 125); davor it with orange flower water and tinge it to alight green color. Mold this paste into medium- sized olive shapes, split them lengthwise through the center and in the crack lay a fine white almond; mold and work the paste to have it assume the form of a natural green almond, then lay them as fast as done on a wire sieve and place in the heater to dry. When finished leave to get cold and glaze over with sugar cooked to \" crack \" (No. 171).","3621":"PARISIAN, WHITE AND PISTACHIO NOUGAT (Nougat Parisien, Blanc et aux Pistaches). Parisian. — This nougat is made of hulled almonds split lengthwise and dried in a hot closet. After dipping them in melted cooked sugar apply them in a large biscuit mold slightly oiled, the flat side of the almond lying against the inside of the mold. If a cylinder mold is used, eight inches high by six in diameter, dip the almonds in the melted sugar and then take them up one by one with a larding needle and range them on their flat side in a double reversed wreath. White Nougat. — White nougat is made of almonds split in two through their thickness and warmed in a heater. Melt in an untinned copper pan one pound of powdered sugar with a tablespoonful of lemon juice; melt this sugar without coloring and when well dissolved mix in the halved almonds. Mold in a plain cylindrical mold, cut off even with the top, and when cold un- mold on a baking sheet and decorate either with candied fruits or spun sugar. Pistachio Nougat. — Have a pound of peeled and very dry pistachio nuts, leave them whole and warm in a heater. Melt a pound of powdered sugar on a slow fire with a tablespoonful of lemon juice; finish the same as the white. Roll both the white and pistachio nougat to a quarter of an inch thick and cut into inch and a quarter bands. This nougat is to be molded in plain and almost straight timbale molds, having just sufficient flare to allow the nougat to be unmolded; garnish the bottom of the mold with a round of pink nougat, (white nougat slightly colored with carmine); adjust the bands on the bias, alternating the white, and fasten them on the inside with bits of nougat dipped in sugar. These nougats are ornamented with fanciful designs of spun sugar. On top place a cupola of spun sugar and over an aigrette of web sugar, or any other tasteful deco- ration. Nougat is also made of hazel-nuts, common nuts, peanuts, Brazil nuts or butter-nuts; in fact with all kinds of almonds, and finished as explained for the others.","3623":"Shell and peel fourteen ounces of sweet almonds; leave to soak in fresh water for three horn's, then pound to a pulp with a little water and kirsch, half of each, just sufficient to moisten the almonds so they do not oil. Cook a pound of sugar to \" crack \" (No. 171), in a round bottom sugar pan, mix the almonds in with the sugar and dry them for a few moments over a slow fire. If for chocolate almond paste add a little grated chocolate or else partly dissolved chocolate. \"White almond paste is colored with vegetal colorings (No. 172). Roll this paste to three-eighths of an inch in thickness and cut it up in small fanciful patterns; dry them in the heater and when sufficiently dry put them to candy (No. 3640) ; they can be flavored with vanilla or any other flavoring. (3624). GUM PASTE (Pastillage.) This is the manner of preparing gum paste used for various purposes: Have half a pound of very white Turkey gum tragacanth either in a glass vessel or a glazed one; wet the gum just sufficiently to have it covered, then close the vessel and leave it at least twelve hours or more. \"When the gum is quite soft and every hard particle disappears under the pressure of the finger put the gum in a heavy new towel; roll the two ends of this around two strong sticks and then twist each forcibly in a contrary direction until all the gum has passed through; lay it on a clean marble and work with the hand, incorporating half a pound of icing sugar sifted through a fine sieve, using more if the gum can absorb a larger quantity. Should the gum paste have too much consistence and recede while working, add a little water and sugar. (It is always preferable to have gum paste prepared the day before.) When it is required for making subjects, figures, dressing, draping, etc., or any other object that requires much manipulation, put a third CONFECTIONERY. 1035 less sugar to the above and replace it by corn starch. Should the gum paste now split it will be the result of too much body, therefore add a little water, sugar, corn starch, etc. If hard lumps be found in the gum tragacanth this is caused from it not being sufficiently or quickly worked with the sugar. For gum paste ornaments and architectural designs ordinary gum paste must be used — all sugar and no starch (only gum, icing sugar and water). Put in as much icing sugar as the gum can absorb without having too much, otherwise it will be impossible to work the paste. Should the edges of the pieces that have been cut out rise up, it is because the paste has too much body, therefore add to it a little ordinary gum paste, icing sugar and water. There must be no contraction whatever; the pieces once cut must remain as they are; dry them in the air, being careful that no dust settles on them and avoid any strong draught. With these cut-out pieces of gum paste pyramids are prepared, using cardboard models prepared in advance. They can be kept when very dry, wrapping them up carefully and placing them on edge between sheets of tissue paper and putting the pieces for each pyramid in a box to be kept in a dry place. When required for use fasten all the pieces of gum paste together with gum paste dissolved in water, having it liquid enough to force through a cornet, or else use royal icing. The paste can be colored with vegetal colorings, or gold, bronze or silver impalpable powders, after exposing the objects a few moments to steam. The gum paste may also be varnished with a varnish prepared as follows: Put a coffeespoonful of cream of tartar into a pint of milk; set it in a hot place and when the milk has soured filter and add four ounces of pulverized gum arabic, four ounces of spirits of wine and one small dissolved gelatine leaf; pour the whole into a bottle and stand it in a hot place for a few hours, then strain thi*ough a fine sieve and keep well corked in a cool spot.

MALAGA KAISINS STUFFED AND GLAZED (Eaisins de Malaga Farcis et GlaceY; Split some fine Malaga raisins in two without separating the parts; remove the seeds and stuff one-third with a half-inch ball of almond paste (No. 125) colored white, another third with the same paste colored pink and the remaining third of almond paste with pistachios (No. 128); all these pastes to be prepared with cooked sugar (No. 3616); roll them into olive shapes, leaving the almond or pistachio paste show through the opening, and lay them at once on a wire sieve, then place in the heater to let get dry and glaze with sugar cooked to \" crack \" (No. 171). (3626). TO SPIN SUGAR BY THROWING (Pour Tiler le Sucre a la Jet&X First have a spinner constructed as follows: On the entire surface of a round of sheet iron five Inches in diameter and an eighth of an inch thick are to be riveted wire pegs an eighth of an inch in diameter and three and a half inches long, and at three-quarters of an inch apart from each other. A solid handle is fastened to the spinner. Cook in a copper pan two or three pounds of sugar to \" large crack\" (No. 171) or three hundred degrees Fahrenheit. As soon as done remove from the fire. Place several clean and oiled baking sheets on the floor. With the left hand take a small stick and hold it horizontally to the height of the chest or else lay it project- ing over the edge of a table; with the right hand plunge the spinner into the sugar, take it out and drain off all the superfluous sugar; then, moving the instrument vigorously backward and forward over the small stick until all the sugar has run off in threads, redip the spinner into the sugar and begin the same movement again, continuing until all the sugar is spun. In case there be no spinner handy, a spoon can be used, dipping it into the cooked sugar, lifting it out and leaving all the surplus sugar drain off by moving it backward and forward the same as the spinner.","3627":"Place some lumps of sugar in a copper pan; pour over sufficient water to soak and leave till dissolved, when mix in a few drops of acetic acid and cook to 245 degrees; then remove from the fire, color a light blue with ultramarine blue and rub it against the sides of the pan with a wooden spoon to grain it. Pour it at once into molds; plaster ones a::e generally used for this purpose, having them properly dipped in cold water, then well drained and tied around firmly with a string so that the sugar cannot escape from the joints of the mold. After the mold is full wait until the sugar congeals on top, then break this thin crust and turn the mold upside down to empty out all the liquid sugar in order to have the subject hollow in the center. Unmold carefully, removing each piece one by one; pare them neatly and lea\"re to cool in a dry, but not a hot place. 1035 THE EPICUREAN.

The entire boat can be made of white or colored gum paste (No. 3624), and the water FIG. 74 imitated with green royal icing (No. 101). This piece may be filled either with fresh or candied fruits, such as Malaga grapes stuffed with almond paste (No. 125); candied cherries or strawberries and angelica, or else instead of these have imitation flowers made of ice cream and angelica lozenges.","3632":"To make the chariot the wheels must first be constructed. The hoops of the wheels are made with thick bands of nougat (No. 3621), three-quarters of an inch broad; bend these around a cylindrical mold four inches in diameter and stick the parts together with cooked sugar (No. 3616). To make the spokes of these wheels, roll out some nougat to three-eighths of an inch in thickness and then divide it into small sticks half the length of the diameter of the hoops of the wheels; when these are all cold fasten the small sticks inside the wheel with cooked sugar, having them laid at even distances apart, and fasten a small round piece of nougat in the center to imitate the naves of the wheel; now make the axles with two pieces of strong wire, each six and a half inches in length; en- velop these in cooked sugar and when cold attach them firmly on the wheels. Make the bottom of the chariot with a layer of nougat twelve inches long by six wide and when this is very cold CONFECTIONERY. 1039 fasten it solidly on the axles. Next make the two ladders as hereby described: Roll out a band of nougat to five-sixteenths of an inch in thickness, pare it straight and even on both ends, having it twelve inches long; divide it lengthwise into four very straight sticks five-sixteenths of an inch wide; roll out some more nougat to a quarter of an inch in thickness and cut this into even sticks three and a quarter inches long; take up two of the long sticks, lay them down parallel at three and a quarter inches distance apart and between these attach diagonally a row of the small sticks slightly apart from one another, and again on these a second row also laid diagonally, but in an opposite direction, so that one row crosses the other. Having finished the first ladder, proceed to make the second. Fasten these two ladders solidly on the bottom of the chariot and against the FIG. 748. wheels. Make the shafts with two very thin wires enveloped in cooked sugar and when cold attact them to the front of the chariot. The socle is now to be made: Have two flats of nougat three- sixteenths of an inch thick, one for the upper part to be seventeen inches long by eleven and a half wide, and the second one for the bottom nineteen inches long by thirteen and a half inches wide; also make four nougat bands for the framework and fasten them firmly with cooked sugar; on this framework lay the second flat and fasten it also to form the socle or stand; fasten around the bottom of this socle a triple row of nougat points cut very evenly and placed symmetrically; decorate the border of the second flat with oak leaves and acorns made of sugar, and lastly con- struct the fence with sticks of nougat cut a quarter of an inch in thickness.

Coat with green sugar two more wires each nine inches long, and leave to cool. Cut out a round bottom twelve inches in diameter, then fasten the dosser on the center of it, pressing it against the two long wires to be used for a support; decorate the whole profusely with leaves and flowers made of satinated pulled sugar (No. 3618), and fill the dosser with mushrooms or strawberries made of almond paste (No. 125), also some angelica coated \\\\ith sugar cooked to \"crack \" (No. 171). The docker may be filled with small ices imitating flowers. (3637). VASES OF PULLED AND DKAWff SUGAE (Vases en Sucre File\" et Tire). All pieces that are made of pulled and spun sugar are exceedingly useful for many reasons, as large-sized pieces can be executed at a comparatively low cost and yet be most elegant, grace- ful and light; besides the rapidity of the execution, they can be made to assume a great variety of shapes, and all this with very few or even no molds. The designs shown in Figs. 753 and 754, FIG. 753 . FIG. 754. will demonstrate the many uses to be made of pulled and spun sugar, and although they demand much skill and attention, yet they do not offer the same difficulties as gum paste. The socles or stands for these pieces may be of white nougat (No. 3622), molded and cut out, and the embellishments around the base of the vases may also be of almond paste (No. 125) glazed with caramel. The three swans seen on one of the socles are made of very white cooked sugar (320 degrees Fahrenheit), poured into slightly oiled tin molds; leave till cold, then unmold. The whole work must be mounted symmetrically, being careful that each part is firmly attached and the piece perfectly secure. For vases of white or colored Booked sugar (No. 3616) trace outlines of the de- signs on marble (see Fig. 733), having sixteen, twenty-four or even thirty-two pieces for each vase. Take a stick six to eight inches higher than the intended vase and coat it with cooked sugar; roll it on the marble until it becomes exceedingly smooth, leave it until cold, then fasten it verti- cally on to the center of the socle; adapt the traced pieces perpendicularly around this stick at equal CO1STFJEOTIOXERY. 1043 distances apart. Prepare the flowers and leaves of pulled sugar (Figs. 735 to 741); mount them on wire stalks covered with sugar, and attach them solidly against the stick inside the top of the vase, spreading them open slightly to enlarge and to give a graceful effect to the blossoms. Decorate the base of the eocle with flowers and leaves of pulled sugar. Should the pieces be very large, then it will be found advisable to mount the bouquet separately and place it in the vase when in position on the dinner table; in this case instead of having the stick higher than the vase it must be at least six inches lower, to leave room for a receptacle intended to receive the flowers, the latter to be the same shape and size as the upper portion of the vase, and to be made of nougat (No. 3622), stand this inside the vase and place the flowers tastefully within.","3638":"Have ready an oval socle made of brown nougat, the same as shown in Fig. 756; decorate it with agricultural implements and leaves of pulled sugar made by hand; the rope around the base of the socle is made with two strings twisted quickly and fastened to the border and around the under base; the top tray is made of green pistachio nougat (No. 3622). On top of the entire socle arrange a wheelbarrow made in four pieces of pink or any other color of pulled sugar, rolled out to three sixteenths of an inch in thickness, then cut out with patterns made beforehand and after the drawing; the shafts and rests are made of wire covered with pulled sugar and bent to the desired FIG. 756. shape. The wheel is of pulled sugar: first make a ring and place a round in the center; join the two together by small sticks of pulled sugar; between the shafts and the wheel pass a wire; fasten it on at each side with cooked sugar. The wheelbarrow is upheld and fastened with sugar cooked to \"crack;\" the flowers that fill the barrow and the border on top are made of pulled sugar to which a little chocolate has been added. This piece of confectionery may be made of gum paste (No. 3624), either white or any light color; the wheelbarrow can be filled, as well as the one above, with glazed fruits or fancy ices, such as potatoes, tomatoes, mushrooms, etc., and the bottom of the socle garnished around with fruits, or fruits in cases glazed with caramel, or with small light waffles dressed in a circle, one overlap- ping the other.","3639":"This pyramid, though quite an old idea, is always sure to be well received. The great variety of its details, and the figures which can be added to it, representing scenes of country life, give it an attractive appearance which can hardly be obtained in architectural pyramids. Although its exe- cution offers no great difficulties, yet great care and exactitude must be taken in the cutting out of the different pieces of which it is composed, for there is the essential point for its successful com- pletion. The cut is a reduction of the original, and can thus serve as a basis for its execution, 1044 THE EPICUREAN. either in multiplying or diminishing its dimensions, according to the desired size of the pyramid. Cut out with great precision patterns of strong cardboard, and, if to be used for nougat, oil them well. The part of the pyramid representing the walls is made of white nougat (No. 3622) with chopped almonds, rolled on the marble to about one-quarter of an inch thick, and with the help of oiled patterns cut out rapidly the windows and the doors. The roof is of nougat covered with imi- tation of tiles made of almond paste (No. 125) colored a light chocolate or a light brick red, rolled to a sheet one-sixteenth of an inch thick. Out out with a tin circular cutter and then put on, begin- ning with the bottom layer, each layer successively overlapping the other. The large platform and the doors are of ordinary brown nougat (No. 3621), the railing of lightly colored chocolate sugar, and composed of pieces cut with a knife and stuck together with melted sugar. The windows are made of sugar boiled to three hundred and thirty degrees, very clear, rolled thin and placed in the interior. FIG. 757. The rustic beams are made of chocolate pulled sugar (No. 3618), the stairways of brown nougat and the wings of the mill are composed of four pieces of wire, covered and rolled in brown cooked sugar, and of white pulled sugar melted and rolled thin, arid cut out with scissors. The little sticks across the wings are made of lightly colored chocolate sugar and put on about one-eighth of an inch apart. The rock or base is twelve inches high, and is composed of two wood platforms, supported by a wood framework, around which bunches of crumpled paper ai'e put on, which is then covered with green nougat, rolled thin and garnished with herbs and plants imitated with green pulled sugar. This whole pyramid can also be made of clear sugar exclusively, boiled to three hundred and thirty-five degrees, very transparent, melted over and poured on a tracing of patterns on marble and filled in as described. Or, further yet, of gum paste (No. 3624) exclusively, in natural colors or white, taking great care, however, not to set up the pieces until each one is perfectly dry. The windows COISTFElOTIOlSTEItY. 1045 could then be imitated by thin sheets of mica or gelatine, and the base of gum paste covered with royal icing (No. 101). Or, the ambitious workman can imitate with gum paste, a miller, a bag on his shoulder, going up the stairway, or two peasants eating and drinking, or a peasant woman with children around her, and many other subjects of country life and customs.

Prepare some nougat with chopped almonds (No. 3621), incorporating sufficient cocoa to color it brown; roll out enough of this to be able to cut out a piece a quarter of an inch thick, sixteen inches long and seven inches wide in the part intended for the base and slightly narrower for the top. Wrap this piece of nougat around a wooden support in imitation of the trunk of a tree and FIG. 758. leavi to cool; coat the wires with nougat proportionately thick according to their length, and thicker on the ends that are to be attached to the trunk; bend them as soon as covered to shape them into knotty and irregular boughs, and leave to cool. Color some white nougat (No. 3622) a pistachio green, roll it out on a marble to a quarter of an inch in thickness, and from it cut a round 'bottom sixteen inches in diameter, then attach it to a board of the same size. At two inches from the edge fasten the trunk of the tree on solidly and decorate it with the boughs, having the heaviest attached to the trunk, and the lighter ones attached to these. Melt some cooked sugar, mix in a little cooo?. and chopped almonds, and with a knife coat over the trunk and the branches to imitate the bark and the roots at the foot of the tree. Pull some dark green-colored sugar, a very little at a time, and with it form leaves as described in No. 3618; trim the branches with these, and also with cherries made of almond paste (No. 125) and glazed, or else substitute pears or little apples, or better still green almonds, but any imitated fruit can be used. Place a ladder against the tree, made of wire covered with chocolate-colored sugar, and on this stand a small image to represent a cupid stealing 1046 THE EPICUREAN. the fruit, and at one side another cupid receiving the picked fruit. Make these figures of gum paste (No. 3624). Make the boughs and bushes around the foot of the tree of pulled sugar (No. 3618), also the rope that surrounds it. These trees can be varied as regards both size and subject. One or more trees can be arranged on a single board without any figures or subjects.","3640":"Cold. — This manner of candying is specially adapted for bonbons. Put some lump sugar in a copper pan, pour over sufficient water to dissolve it, and as soon as this takes place set it on the fire to cook to thirty-five degrees; when the sugar has attained this degree take the pan from the fire and stand it in a basin or any other receptacle filled with cold water; cover the sugar with a round of paper, and leave stand till cold.

Fill these boxes with very dry starch to a quarter of an inch from the top; stir about with a small whip to have it light, then smooth neatly with a ruler; now imprint into it with small plaster molds fastened on to a second ruler at some distance apart, burying them in the starch until the ruler touches the edges of the box. Should these small molds have a channeled surface or deeply imprinted designs, then before lifting them out of the starch rap the ruler lightly on top to have any of the starch that may adhere fall away. Care must be taken to sift the starch FIG. 759. ~ from time to time to rid it of any lumps or grains of sugar that may have formed therein. To cast the sugar use a funnel in the center of which is a rod terminating in a ball that fits the outlet of the funnel accurately.

Take the pan from the fire and pour both sugar and almonds into a coarse sieve to separate the almonds from the granu- lated sugar, return the almonds to the pan, stand it on the fire and stir constantly until the sugar covering the almonds melts away, adding from time to time a small handful of the granulated sugar. As soon as all the sugar is added and that surrounding the almonds is well dissolved, pour it immediately on to a slab, separating them from each other, and leave to cool. Put a heaping tablespoonful of dissolved gum arabic in a basin, dilute it with a little water and let it come to a boil; then add the burnt almonds and toss until entirely covered; pour at once on to a sieve and place in the heater to dry.","3643":"Melt twelve ounces of chocolate in a copper pan with a pint and a half of good cream and half a pint of fruit syrup well flavored with vanilla, then add a pound and a half of sugar. Stand the pan on a hot fire and wren the liquid begins to boil stir it vigorously with a spatula until it CONFECTIONERY. 1047 reaches \"large ball\" (No. 171), then pour it on a slightly oiled marble to half an inch in thickness, securing the caramel within lightly oiled square iron rods laid in the shape of a square. This caramel takes a long while to cool; when cold remove the rulers, detach from the marble and cut it first into long bands half an inch wide, and these across in half-inch squares. As fast as the caramels are cut wrap each one in a piece of waxed paper.","3644":"Set a pound of sugar in a copper pan to melt with three-quarters of a pint of cream, adding a split vanilla bean; stand the pan on a brisk fire and stir steadily until cooked to \" large ball \" (No. 171), then pour it in a square formed on the marble with slightly oiled square iron rods, having it the same thickness as the chocolate caramels. When cold cut out and wrap in waxed papers, finishing them exactly the same as the chocolates. These caramels can be flavored with tea or coffee, proceeding as for the above, only using one pound of sugar, two gills of cream and a gill and a half of infused tea or coffee.","3645":"These candies are cast in starch. First prepare the boxes of starch, impressed as explained in No. 3641; put two pounds of sugar in a copper basin, dissolve with three gills of water and stand it on the fire to cook the sugar to thirty-six degrees (syrup gauge); when the sugar attains this degree add a small cordial glassful of kirsch, maraschino or any other desired cordial, to bring the syrup back to thirty-two degrees, stirring it well. Now pour this syrup into a spring funnel (Fig. 759) and cast the candies in the starch impressions; put the filled box in the heater at a moderate temperature and leave for twelve hours. They should now have formed a sufficiently thick crust to allow them to be worked; remove carefully from the starch, brush one at a time with a very soft hair brush, and lay them at once on a grate to cool, then stand this grate on a candy pan and cover the candies with a cold thirty-two degree syrup; lay a piece of paper on top to keep the candies submerged. Put this candy pan in a mild temperature and leave for six hours. Then drain off the syrup, take out the candies to arrange them on a second grate and leave to dry. Instead of crystallizing these candies they can be iced with fondant (No. 58) flavored with cordial.","3646":"These are made by mixing powdered sugar from which the icing sugar has been removed by sifting through a very fine sieve, flavored either with aromatics or fruit juices, to the consistency of a paste. They are all prepared exactly alike; those composed of fruit should be a little more liquid and a little less heated than those with aromatically flavored waters. They should all be dropped on to bright tin plates.","3647":"Mix seven ounces of the same sugar as above with about two ounces of water, flavored with a few drops of peppermint essence, to form into a paste; heat it the same as for the strawberry drops, only warming it rather more, and finish exactly the same.","3648":"Place seven ounces of powdered sugar, prepared as (No. 3646), in a small copper pan having a spout, and reduce it to the consistency of a paste with about an ounce of filtered strawberry juice; color lightly with liquid carmine to give it a pink hue. Stand the pan on the fire and heat until the paste flows, stirring continuously with a small spatula; however, it must be of a consistency not to spread when dropped on the trays. To dress, hold the pan in the left hand, inclining the spout toward the tray, and in the right hand hold a small wire; with this cut the paste away from the spout as fast as it runs out, thus leaving it fall in small pieces to form into drops three-eighths of an inch in diameter and slightly apart from each other. Half an hour after they can be detached from the tray by bending it slightly and then shaking them; throw on a sieve to finish drying.","3649":"Procure small plaster molds imitating hazel-nuts and fasten them to a ruler, then imprint them in starch. Peel six ounces of filberts and crush to form a very fine paste with a gill and a 1048 THE EPICUREAN. half of water. Cook a pound of sugar to \" small crack \" (No. 171), add the pounded nuts, stir well and cast it at once into the starch impressions; when these candies have sufficiently hardened in the starch to be able to be handled take them out, one by one, brush carefully and stand on a sieve to cool; they can afterward be dipped in cold crystallized syrup until completely coated with candy.","3650":"then pour it on a marble slab and leave to cool; work to obtain a fondant, proceeding the same as for No. 58. Put a part of this in a copper pan to melt, adding a spoonful of vanilla syrup, then cast this in the starch. As soon as the candies are firm and cold take them out and brush over; melt the remainder of the fondant, softening it with vanilla syrup, and dip the candies in this.","3651":"Have some conical-shaped molds, with rounded tops, a quarter of an inch in diameter at their base and a quarter of an inch high; impress them into the starch. Put one pound of fondant (No. 58) in a sugar pan, add two tablespoonfuls of thirty-four degree syrup strongly flavored with vanilla and stand it on the fire to heat until the finger can yet be held in, then pour it into a spring funnel (Fig. 759) and run it through into the impressions in the starch; when the candies are cold and firm take them carefully from the starch, brush gently with a brush and stand them on a grate, then put away in a cold place. These can be dipped in fondant well flavored with vanilla.","3652":"Pr/c some fondant into a copper pan and heat well, dissolving it with a few spoonfuls of straw- berry or raspberry juice. As soon as hot cast it through a funnel into the starch, proceeding the same as for vanilla fondant (No. 3651). When firm and cold take them carefully from the starch and dip each one in a strawberry or raspberry fondant lightly tinted with a little carmine.","3653":"Have some small conical-shaped plaster molds, the bottoms being detruncated and rounded; they should be an inch in diameter at the bottom and one inch high. Fasten these molds on a ruler slightly apart from each other, then with this ruler imprint the molds into the starch. Put two pounds of sugar in a copper sugar basin and dissolve ii; with a pint and a half of water; stand this on the fire to cook to \" large ball \" (No. 171), being careful to remove all the scum and keep the sides of the pan clean. When the sugar has reached the proper degree let it fall to \"small ball\" by adding a few spoonfuls of orange flower water, then remove the pan from the fire and with a wooden spoon rub the sugar against the sides to mass it. As soon as it begins to whiten stir it well and cast it into the starch impressions, using a spring funnel (Fig. 759) for this purpose; when the box is full bestrew the candies lightly with a handful of starch and put the box in a heater for two or three hours. After the candies are hard remove them from the starch and range them on grates or on a sieve to cool thoroughly, then brush over with a camel's hair or feather brush. To wrap up these candies spread open some variegated colored motto papers, in th^ center of each lay a printed motto folded in four and on this one of the candies, then fold the p^per all around toward the center and use a string attached to the table to enclose the candy (this is done by giving the string a turn around the motto and pulling on it, then the motto is released and will be found firmly twisted) and form a bouquet with the fringed ends of the paper.","3654":"Fasten some plaster half-spherical or convex molds on a ruler and with it make the impressions in the starch. Prepare a pint of apple jelly the same as in No. 3668, only cooking it a little more; bring this to the ordinary degree of cooking, adding either rum, kirsch or other liquor, then cast it in the starch impressions through a spring funnel (Fig. 759). Put the boxes in a heater and leave for eight or ten hours. By this time the jelly will have formed into thin crusts sufficiently hardened to be taken out carefully and laid on a wire sieve. When cold, brush each one separately with a fine hair brush and then dip into a liquor-flavored fondant (No. 58). Instead of dipping them in the fondant they can be candied by laying them in a cold syrup, the same as for No. 3659.

Whip eight egg-whites in a copper basin to a stiff froth, add the honey and the cooked sugar and continue beating the whites on a slow fire until the preparation is at \"small crack\" (two hundred and ninety degees Fahrenheit). This degree of heat will be recognized by taking up a small part with the tip of a knife, dipping it in cold water, and when crumbled it should fall into a powder. During this time cook three pounds of sugar to \" crack \" (three hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit); mix it with the whites, adding five pounds of whole almonds and a quarter of a pound of hulled and dried pistachios. Fill some oblong tin cases with this, having them previously lined with white wafers. Pour the nougat in the case, leave to cool, then cut in slices. Another Proportion is a pound and three-quarters of almonds, one pound of sugar, one pound of white honey, five egg-whites, a quarter of a pound of pistachios, two ounces of burnt almonds, and vanilla; finish the same as the above. Hard White Nougat. — Four pounds of heated honey, two pounds of sugar cooked to \" ball\" (three hundred and twenty-six degrees Fahrenheit), two pounds cooked to \" small crack\" (two hun- dred and ninety degrees Fahrenheit), five pounds of almonds, a quarter of a pound of pistachios and five beaten egg-whites.

The same preparation as for the soft white nougat.","3656":"Place one pound of loaf sugar in a copper sugar basin with sufficient water to melt, then stand it on the fire to cook to three hundred and twenty-five degrees Fahrenheit, being careful to keep the sides clean, and proceed as explained for cooking sugar (No. 171). When ready pour it on a lightly oiled marble, add at once a few drops of peppermint essence and begin to raise up the edges, bringing them toward the center until the sugar can be handled with the hands, then begin to pull till it attains a very glossy, silvery appearance; pull again to a quarter of an inch in diame- ter string, and cut this quickly into small pieces an inch and a half long, bending each one imme- diately into the shape of a ring. The pulling, cutting and bending should be performed with despatch, before the sugar has time to cool, when it will fail to bend. The sugar may be colored either light pink or pale green just when flavoring.","3657":"Proceed the same as for Trocaderos with rum (No. 3658), using a pound and a half of sugar and a gill and a half of raspberry pulp strained through a very fine sieve and two and a half gills of rich cream. After removing from the starch and well brushed, dip in a thin royal icing (No. 101) slightly tinted with carmine and flavored with a little raspberry juice.","3658":"Cook a pound and a half of sugar to \"small crack\" (No. 171), adding three gills of cream, and let it boil up once only; put in half a gill of rum and cast it at once in starch imprinted with small lozenge-shaped molds; set the box away in the heater for twelve hours. Now remove the candies one by one from the starch, brush carefully and range them on a grate; dip the candies in a light royal icing (No. 101) well flavored with rum.","3659":"Select a pound of full-bloom violets; suppress the stalks and throw into cold water to refresh, then spread them on a towel to drain. Cook a pound and a quarter of sugar to \"small ball\" (No. 171), throw in the violets, remove the pan from the fire at once and stir gently to submerge them. Boil this up once and then transfer immediately to a vessel. The following day drain them on a sieve, pour the syrup back into a copper pan, add a little more sugar, and cook again to \" small ball;\" put in the flowers and transfer once more to the vessel to leave for another twelve hours; after this drain off again, pour this syrup back into the pan, boil it once or twice and add the violets, remov- ing the pan at once from the fire.

Cork the bottles hermetically when the cherries are cold and put away in a cool place.","3661":"Have some white even-sized figs; prick and leave them to soak for twelve hours in salted water. Parboil them properly, keeping them firm, then drain and refresh by throwing them into a plentiful supply of cold salted water and leave them to steep for two or three days; now put them in a copper pan and cover with a hot twenty-two degree syrup so that they macerate for six hours; afterward drain off this syrup, add to it more sugar and let cook to twenty- five degrees; when this is cold pour it over the figs: repeat this operation until the sugar attains thirty degrees. Drain the figs well, put them into glass jars and cover with brandy; let macerate for six weeks, then add for every quart of brandy two gills of thirty-degree syrup.","3662":"Take fine sound greengages; prick over and blanch; have them resume their former green color the same as for preserved greengages (No. 3679), and when well refreshed drain again and arrange them in glass jars, each one to contain a vanilla bean; cover with good white brandy and cork the jars hermetically; leave them thus for fifteen days. After this lapse of time dram off the brandy and add some sugar to it, allowing three pounds for each gallon of liquid; stir well together; when the sugar is dissolved pour it over the fruits; close the jars hermetically and leave them in a cool place. (3663) BEANDY PEACHES (Peches a 1'Eau de Vie). Let the peaches be white and sound; rub with a cloth to remove their down, prick the surfaces and lay them in cold water; drain this off and place them in a basin, covering with fresh cold water into which has been added a small piece of alum; set the basin on the fire and as soon as the liquid begins to heat stir the fruits about from time to time, and when they float on top of the liquid remove and throw them again into cold water. Drain and arrange them in one-quart glass jars, having a quarter of a vanilla stick in each, and cover with good white brandy. Close the bottles hermetically and stand them in a cool place to leave for fifteen days, and then drain off the brandy into a basin, add sugar to it, allowing three pounds for each gallon; stir well to melt the sugar, then pour this liquor over the peaches; cork the jars so no air whatever can enter and lay aside in a cool place.","3664":"Suppress the stalks and pips from some fine, very ripe but sound cherries; range them at once in tin cans of a quart capacity and cover with a twenty-five degree cold syrup; put on the lids and solder tightly. Stand these cans in a large saucepanful of cold water, set it covered on the fire and boil the water for seven minutes, then remove at once from the fire and allow the cans to cool off in the liquid.","3665":"Select pears that are ripe yet firm (Sickle pears in preference); peel, turning them round, and empty with a vegetable scoop to remove all the pips, blanch and refresh. Drain as soon as they are properly cooled off and range them in tin cans each of a quart capacity; fill the can nine- tenths full with a fifteen-degree cold syrup; cover and solder.

Remove the cans, punch a small hole on top to allow the air to escape and solder immediately; replace the saucepan and allow to boil five minutes more. If whole pineapples, merely cored, are used instead of slices they will require forty minutes boiling, and if not cored one hour will be found a correct time.","3667":"Peel the hearts of some small celery stalks; parboil them well in acidulated water, and when very tender drain and wipe on a cloth; range them in a flat dish and cover with a cold twenty- five degree syrup. Six hours after drain off this syrup and mix in with it some sugar steeped in water and cooked to thirty degrees, adding the juice of one lemon; pour this again over the celery hearts and six hours later recommence the operation. When cold dress into a preserve dish with the syrup poured over.","3668":"Cut two dozen russet apples in slices, lay them in a basin with water to cover; cook tender, then pour them on a sieve to drain off the juice, collecting it in a bowl; filter this through a flannel bag and put it into the basin again with the same weight of sugar; dissolve thoroughly, mixing together with a skimmer, then set the basin on the fire and cook until the syrup coats the spatula and falls down in beads; stir continuously with the skimmer. As soon as the liquid reaches the proper degree pour it at once into stone pots or glasses previously heated ; leave to cool thoroughly. Lay on the jelly a round of paper soaked in brandy, and afterward cover the glasses with strong paper or parchment. Orange Jelly. — Remove the peel from a few nice oranges, cut it in very thin shreds, blanch them well and then drain. Pare the oranges to the pulp.

Put the cherries in a copper pan on a slow fire and reduce to half, then add three pounds of sugar and one pound of the strained currant and kernel juice, and continue to cook until a drop of it placed on a flat surface will not spread; now put in half a gill of kirsch and pour at once into jars to leave in a cool place until thoroughly cold; cover with a round of paper dipped in brandy, and close the pots hermetically with their respective covers. (3670). CURRANT JELLY AND PLAIN CURRANT JELLY; CRANBERRY JELLY (Gelee de Groseille et Gele\"e de Groseille Simple ; Gelee de Canneberges). Have one pound of currants free of stalks and one pound of powdered sugar; mix both together in a vessel without crusting the currants; when the sugar is dissolved pour the whole into a copper pan and stand it on the fire; after it has been boiling for five or six minutes the syrup will have cooked to the proper degree, that is, until it coats the skimmer and drops from it in beads. Now pour the fruit and syrup on to a sieve laid over a vessel fit to receive the liquid, and use this to fill jelly glasses; keep slightly warm for two hours, then leave to cool before covering the glasses with paper. Another way is to select the currants when not too ripe; pick off all the stalks and put the fruit in a copper pan with three-quarters of their weight of powdered sugar; when this is partly melted stand the pan on a slow fire to bring the liquid to a boil while skimming; boil it once or twice only; skim well, strain through a napkin and pour into jelly glasses. Plain. — Slightly cook ten pounds of currants with their stalks in a copper pan; pass them through a sieve having sufficiently fine meshes to prevent the seeds from passing; mix an equal weight of 1052 THE EPICUREAN. sugar to this juice; cook until it coats the skimmer and drops from it in beads, being careful to skim during the whole process of cooking. Fill some heated glasses or jars, and when cold cover with a round of paper soaked in brandy, then cover the top of the vessel with strong paper. Cranberry Jelly. — Crush about two pounds of very ripe cranberries, dilute with a little water and strain the juice through a jelly bag. Pour this juice into an untinned copper pan and add a pound of sugar to each pint of liquid; let it cook on a good fire to the consistency of a jelly, fol- lowing the directions found in No. 3668.

When the jelly is perfectly cold cover with round pieces of paper dipped in brandy, and cork up the pots or glasses to close them hermetically.","3671":"Pick some not too ripe red currants from their stalks; lay them in a copper preserving pan and set this on the fire; as soon as the fruits have dissolved strain the juice forcibly through a cloth into a vessel; pour this back into the pan and add one and a half pounds of sugar for each quart of juice. When the sugar has all melted place the pan on a hot fire and cook it until the preparation dropped from the skimmer forms into a jelly, or else if a drop be placed on a flat sur- face it will retain the shape of a bead and not spread, being careful to stir the liquid continuously with a skimmer. As soon as the jelly is cooked pour it into stone pots or heated glasses. In order to have it fine and clear no more than two gallons should be cooked at once. Currant Jelly with Apples. — Prepare the currant juice as above and add an equal quantity of liquid in which apples have been cooked, then finish as for the above, when a currant and apple jelly will be obtained.","3672":"Choose well-ripened, good, sound quinces; peel, cut in four, and immerse them in a basin of water. Cover the basin, place it on the fire, and cook the quinces thoroughly, then pour them on a sieve to drain off the juice, collecting it in a bowl. Filter this juice through a flannel bag, return it to the bowl, add the same weight of sugar, cook and finish the same as apple jelly.","3673":"Gather the grapes when quite ripe, place them in a vessel and pound without mashing them too much, to extricate as little coloring matter as possible. Pour the whole into a thick flannel bag to filter the juice, letting it fall into a porcelain or glass receptacle. Commence the operation again, and continue to filter the juice through the bag until it flows out quite clear. After all the juice has been filtered pour it into small strong bottles (small champagne bottles), and cork with sound corks, driving them in with a mallet; tie the corks down with strings attached to the necks of the bottles, then stand them upright, slightly apart, in a deep saucepan or soup pot, and cover to the height of the bottles with cold water. Place the pot on a moderate fire, boil for ten to twelve minutes, remove and leave the bottles cool in the water, only taking them out when thoroughly cold. Cut the strings and lay the bottles down flat, keeping them in a very cool place. Crush some very ripe strawberries and press them on a wire sieve sufficiently fine not to permit the seeds to pass through. With this juice fill some one-quart bottles, close well, tying the corks on with a string. Range these bottles in a saucepan, cover with cold water and stand it on the range. Watch the time when the water begins to boil and leave them in for only half an hour, then take the saucepan at once from the fire and leave the bottles cool off thoroughly in the liquid. When cold lift them out, wipe dry, cut the strings and lay them down, piling one on top of the other in a cool, dry place, inclining the bottles a little forward so that the juice rests against the cork.","3674":"Quarter some apples, core and cut up small; put them into a basin with the juice of several lemons and a little water; cook. As soon as done pour on a sieve to drain, pressing them through afterward. Add to this pulp three-quarters of its weight of lump sugar, and stir well together. Pour it all into a tinned copper pan and stand it on the fire to cook the marmalade until it coats the spatula and drops from it in beads; stir continuously with a spatula. As soon as it is done pour into stone pots that have been previously heated.

Melt over the fire, stirring constantly with a spatula, then strain the pulp through a sieve and weigh it. Cook three-quarters of its weight of sugar to \" small crack \" (No. 171); when it has attained this degree remove from the fire and pour the pulp into it, stirring vigorously; continue to cook until it coats the skimmer and the jelly drops in beads, then transfer immediately to stone pots or glasses heated beforehand. The jam must be quite cold before covering it over; keep in a cool, dry place. Apple, Apricot, Peach, Quince and Chestnut Paste. — Prepare a puree of apples, apricots, peaches, quinces or chestnuts; add to either one of these three-quarters of a pound of sugar cooked to \" small crack \" (No. 171); reduce until the preparation detaches itself from the pan; spread this about one-eighth of an inch thick on sheets of tin or it may be pushed through a cornet in rounds. Put in a hot closet for two days, remove from the tins and when cut roll in coarse powdered sugar.","3676":"Select large white, ripe, but very firm figs; remove the skins and cut up the fruits; weigh, and for each pound allow seven ounces of sugar dissolved in a little water. Boil this up once or twice, put in the figs and cook until the marmalade coats the skimmer and drops from it in beads, then pour into glass jars previously heated. Orange Marmalade.— Choose some not too ripe oranges, remove their zests with the knife shown in Fig. 156, prick them with a coarse needle and put them in a pan with boiling water; cover them over to cook until the remaining skin becomes softened, then place in an abundance of cold water for twenty-four hours. Drain, open them, suppress the seeds, and pass the orange and peel through a sieve. Cook the same weight of sugar to \" ball\" (No. 171) as there is orange, mix both together and cook until the marmalade falls from the skimmer in a sheet.","3677":"Suppress all the rind and seeds from the fruit and rub this through a sieve. If very sweet a quarter of a pound of sugar will suffice for each pound of pulp; reduce the marmalade in a cop- per pan until it covers the skimmer and drops from it in beads, then pour it into glasses.","3678":"Have one pound of large picked white currants and a pound of loaf sugar; seed the fruits, using a pointed goose quill, and lay them in a vessel. Put half a pound of the sugar into a sugar pan with two gills of water, let it soak, then cook it to \" bead \" (No. 171); mix in the berries, leaving their juice in the vessel, and place the pan on the side of the range; five minutes later pour both fruits and liquid into a bowl, and three hours after lay a small sieve over the sugar pan and pour the fruits and syrup into this. Mix with the syrup half of the remaining sugar, and let it melt thoroughly, then cook it until it coats the skimmer and drops from it in beads; return the cur- rants to the syrup; give them a single boil and return the whole to the bowl. Four hours after strain the syrup into the pan again, put the rest of the sugar with it and cook once more until it coats the skimmer; now add the currants and boil the whole up once. Set the pan back on the range for five minutes, but so that the syrup does not boil. Pour the jam into small jelly glasses; let get very cold before closing with paper. A few spoonfuls of clear apple juice can be added if necessary to give more consistency to the preserve.","3679":"Take twenty pounds of very green and sound greengages, prick the surfaces with a large pin and throw into a panful of cold water. Fill an untinned copper pan holding ten gallons three- quarters full of water; add a heavy handful of salt, three gills of vinegar and three handfuls of spinach; stir the liquid so all the ingredients are properly mingled; drain the gages from their water and throw them into the copper pan; stand it on the fire. After the water begins to heat stir the fruits around carefully with a skimmer, and as soon as they float on the surface take them out and throw into a panful of cold water; place under a faucet and allow the water to flow over them. Prepare a twelve-degree syrup; drain the greengages properly and throw them into this, then let boil up once, pouring them afterward into shallow vessels to leave for twelve hours. Drain off the 1054 THE EPICUREAN. syrup, add a little sugar, and boil it again several times until it attains fourteen degrees, then throw it over the fruits and let stand again for twelve hours. Continue this operation daily until the syrup reaches thirty degrees; for the last time drain off the syrup once more, and boil it to thirty-two degrees; then put in the fruits, boil up once and transfer the whole to jars; close her- metically as soon as cold and keep in a cool, dry place.","3680":"Remove the cores from the limes with a quarter-inch tin tube and leave them to soak in a pailful of water, adding a heavy handful of salt; let them remain four hours in this, then drain and throw them into a large basin of boiling water to blanch. As soon as soft take them up one by one and put into a pailful of cold water to refresh, changing it at frequent intervals. To have them turn green again, put ten quarts of water in an untiuned copper pan, add two heaping handfuls of kitchen salt, half a pint of vinegar and a few handfuls of spinach; stand this vessel on the fire and boil for a few moments; drain the limes from their water and throw them into this while still in the act of boiling, allowing them to boil up several times. Take the basin from the fire and leave the fruits therein for three or four hours; they should now have assumed their natural color. Drain and plunge them into a pailful of cold water for twelve hours, changing it frequently during this time. Prepare a fifteen-degree syrup. As soon as it boils drain the limes and throw them into this, boil up once, then transfer the whole to vessels and leave in a cool place for twelve hours. The following day pour off the syrup and cook it to sixteen degrees, throw it once more over the fruits, leaving it for twelve hours; drain the syrup again, boil until it reaches twenty degrees, then pour it over the limes and leave for twelve hours longer, repeating the pro- cess every twelve hours until the syrup reaches thirty-two degrees, then pour it back into the basin and as soon as it begins to boil throw in the limes and boil up once. Transfer them immediately to their respective stone jars, cool and close hermetically.","3681":"Cut some oranges or lemons in four, remove the pulp and put the peels in a basin with water; blanch thoroughly. When they are soft to the touch take from the fire, drain and put them in a panful of cold water; leave to soak for twenty-four hours, changing the liquid from time to time, or, if possible, stand the pan under the faucet and let the water run over continuously, then drain. Eange the peels in a vessel, cover with a boiling syrup at fifteen degrees and leave them in for twelve hours; at the expiration of that time drain off the syrup, boil it up to eighteen degrees, then pour it again over the peels, leaving them steep for ten or twelve hours. Repeat this opera- tion six or seven times, gradually increasing the strength of the syrup until it reaches thirty-two degrees. The last time prepare a fresh thirty-two degree syrup. Drain the fruits from the syrup they are in and put them into this fresh one that is in the act of boiling; boil up once; remove from the fire and lay them in stone pots, covering with this last syrup; close hermetically when quite cold.","3682":"PRESERVED— LARGE (Grosses Peches Entieres CoBfites). The Brothers Carresa, of Nice, France, prepare boxes of preserved peaches, each one containing only four, but of extraordinary size; in the boxes are also leaves, blanched with acid; they can be arranged so exquisitely that they easily pass for fine fresh ones. Drain off the peaches one by one, wipe dry on a fine cloth, then tint their surfaces with powdered carmine dissolved in water and pounded with the finger. This first layer should only be slightly tinted, then begin again on eacb side of the parting division, spreading the color over well with the finger so as to represent the bright shades of a fresh peach. As soon as they are tinted place them on a dish and cover entirely with clear jelly, applying it with a brush. First dress three of these peaches in a preserve dish and lay the fourth one on top of the under triangle; surround with a few peach leaves and pour some thick syrup into the bottom of the dish, being careful not to spill any over the peaches.","3683":"Apricots, green almonds, greengages, mirabelles, cherries, and in fact all preserved fruits, must first be washed in hot water to remove the sugar adhering to them, then drain and leave to dry properly. After these fruits are very dry arrange them in a single layer, one beside the other, in a candy pan having a grate on the bottom; when this first grate is full lay another one on top and fill it the same as the other, and continue thus until they reach to slightly below the CONFECTIONERY. 1055 edges of the candy pan. Cover the last layer of fruits with another grate, and on it lay a weight to keep the fruits submerged in the syrup. Now cook a sufficient quantity of sugar to thirty- four degrees to cover the whole of the fruit and pour it over as soon as done; put these fruits in a hot closet and leave without disturbing for twelve hours; at the end of that time drain the fruits from this syrup, lay them on dry grates and leave till very dry. A good way to judge of the thickness of the layers of candy is to put small pieces of wood reaching above the edges of the candy pan into the corners at the same time as the fruits. After a few hours take out one of these pieces of wood, drain it well and see whether it be covered with a sufficiently thick layer of candy; if the layer attached to this piece of wood be the desired thickness then certainly the fruit should be covered the same, and if not thick enough then leave the fruits in the closet for a longer time. After the lapse of a short time draw out another one of the sticks and observe it the same as the first, and continue this operation until the candy be of the desired thickness; then drain off the fruits and dry them the same as described above. Preserved Pears. — Choose fine, sound Sickle pears in preference to others; peel them round, suppress the cores with a small vegetable spoon, and lay them at once in cold water; drain from this and blanch, taking them out one by one as soon as they rise on the surface of the boiling liquid and throw them into a panful of cold water to refresh. Drain immediately; put them into a boiling syrup at twelve degrees, leave in a cool place for twelve hours; drain the syrup, adding a little sugar to bring to fourteen degrees, pour it over the pears, and the next day draw this off, add a little sugar to bring the syrup to sixteen degrees, and continue the process daily, each time augment- ing the syrup two degrees until it has reached thirty degrees; now drain off this syrup from the pears, boil it up by itself once or twice, and when it attains thirty-two degrees put in the fruit; give it one more boil and transfer the whole to jars to cool. As soon as cold close hermetically and leave in a cool, dry place. Preserved Fruits Coated with Grained Sugar. — To coat preserved fruits with grained sugar proceed the same as for fruits with candy. Cook some sugar to \" thread \" (No. 171), take from the fire and with a wooden spoon spread a layer on the sides of the pan in which it has been cooked and rub it on for a few seconds with the spoon. As soon as this rubbed sugar begins to whiten mix it with the remainder of the sugar, then dip in the fruits, using a fork, and range them at once on a grate, leaving them till the sugar be dry. Preserved and Fresh Fruits Coated with Caramel. — For preserved fruits that have to be coated with caramel, proceed first by washing them in hot water, drain and cut them into halves or quarters, or leave whole, according to necessity and to the nature of the fruits, then stick them on wires pierced into a cork and leave them to dry. When ready, cook some sugar to \"large crack \" (No. 171), or three hundred and forty degrees. As soon as it has attained this heat take it at once from the fire and dip in the fruits, then lay them on a marble to drain and cool; when nearly cold pull out the wires. For Quartered Oranges. — Peel and separate in sections, leave to dry, then dip them in the sugar, using a pair of pastry pincers, and then lay them one by one on a slightly greased marble. For Grapes. — Take them off their stalks and dip them the same way as the oranges. These fruits are used for decorating pyramids and for cases of iced fruits.","3684":"Pare some very ripe pineapples to the pulp, suppress the cores with a tin tube and cut them up into quarter-inch thick crosswise slices; throw them immediately into a panful of cold water, drain and put them into a basin of boiling water to blanch, refreshing afterward in a pan- ful of cold water. Prepare a twelve-degree syrup, add to it the well-drained pineapple and boil up once. Now transfer to vessels to leave stand for twelve hours. At the end of this time drain off the syrup and pour it into a copper pan. Add a little sugar, boil to bring it to fourteen degrees, then add the pineapple; twelve hours later boil the syrup a little more, until it reaches sixteen degrees; pour it over the fruit and continue this same process until the syrup is at thirty degrees; when this takes place boil up several times, throw in the sliced pineapple and leave them for a few moments, then transfer the whole to jars; when cold close hermetically and keep in a cool, dry place.","3685":"Quarter some good, sound quinces; peel, core and throw them at once into cold water, then plunge them into boiling water and boil until they become quite tender. Refresh, drain and range 1056 THE EPICUREAN. them in wide, shallow vessels; cover with boiling syrup at fifteen degrees and keep them in a cool place for twenty to twenty-four hours; drain off the syrup, add a little sugar, boil up and let it attain two degrees more; continue the same process until it reaches thirty degrees; then drain the syrup again, add a little more sugar and boil until it reaches thirty-two degrees, then put in the fruits and boil up once. Pour into stone jars and when cold close hermetically.","3686":"Peel some fine medium-sized apples; suppress the cores with a tin tube, rub the surfaces with half a lemon and cook in a twelve-degree acidulated syrup, being careful to keep them whole. As soon as done drain and range in a tureen, cover with fresh syrup at thirty-two degrees, leaving to cool in this; keep the syrup they were cooked in for further use. Drain the apples from their syrup and dress on a compote dish ; filter the syvup kept aside, add a little sugar to it and cook it to the consistency of a jelly (see apple jelly, No. 3668); leave this stand for one moment on the corner of the range, then pour it over the apples; serve when cold.","3687":"Skin some sound bananas; suppress the coarse threads and throw them immediately into boil- ing water; drain at once, then transfer them to a hot twenty-eight degree syrup; leave to cool in this. Drain once more, range them pyramidically in a compote dish and cover with their own syrup; they are now ready.","3688":"Cut the stalks halfway up from a pound of fine, large, sour cherries. Boil a light syrup in a sugar pan, just having sufficient to cover the fruit, then throw in the cherries; toss them for two minutes, boiling the liquid up once only, then pour the whole into a bowl to leave till cold. Lay both syrup and fruits on a sieve placed on top of the sugar pan and take away some of the fallen syrup, pouring sufficient sugar into the remainder that when boiled again it forms a thick syrup; as this becomes almost cold add the cherries to it, take from the fire and half an hour later dress the stewed fruit. (3689). STEWED OB21STNUTS (Compote de Marrons). Suppress the shells from two pounds of fresh chestnuts without breaking the meats; soak them for seven or eight hours in cold water with a little citric acid added. Drain and place in a recently tinned saucepan with plenty of water, having a bag containing bran. At the first boil remove the pan to the side of the fire so that the liquid only quivers for two hours, being careful to replace at times a part of the black water by a little clean boiling water, so as to keep the chestnuts as white as possible. \"When tender but yet whole, drain off a few at a time to peel without get- ting cold, then put them at once into another saucepan with tepid syrup cooked to twelve degrees and half a stick of split vanilla; use only the whole chestnuts. Cover the saucepan and keep it on one side of the range to have the liquid hot without boiling, and two hours after drain off half the syrup, replacing it by a stronger hot one of thirty degrees; keep the chestnuts in this for one hour on the side of the fire. Drain them again delicately one by one to dress on a compote dish; strain the syrup, reduce it to twenty-eight degrees, and when cold pour it over the chestnuts.","3690":"Cut each of four or five good oranges into six parts; pare them to the pulp, suppressing the peels and white skin, then extract the seeds. Put the oranges into a bowl and pour over a few spoonfuls of thirty-degree cold syrup flavored with orange peel and a little kirsch; half an hour after dress the fruits with the syrup poured over. Orange Salad. — Select sweet, juicy oranges, peel them to the pulp, cut in crosswise slices, and range them in a circle in a dish; bestrew with sugar and pour rum over. Orange and Apple Salad. — Peel some fine, sound apples, core and cut them up into thin slices, dress them in a circle on a dish with slices of orange between each piece of apple, throw powdered sugar over, and pour on some kirsch and rum. CONFECTIONERY. 1057","3691":"Select very fine, sound, ripe peaches or apricots, cut them in two, peel and lay them in a twenty-eight degree boiling syrup; leave to quiver for a few moments on the side of the range, remove from the fire and put them into a tureen, leaving to cool in their own syrup; drain and dress on a compote dish, pouring the syrup over.","3692":"Cut some fine ripe pears in two or four, but if small keep whole; throw them into a saucepan containing cold water; blanch in hot water acidulated with the juice of a lemon; drain, range in a vessel, and cover with a boiling twenty-eight degree syrup; leave them in this until cold, then drain, dress and pour over the syrup after reducing it.","3693":"Pare neatly a fine pineapple; remove the core with a tin tube; split lengthwise in two, and cut each half in crosswise slices three-sixteenths of an inch thick. Arrange these in a vessel, and pour over some boiling thirty-two degree syrup, leaving them to marinate for two hours, then dress m A circle on a compote dish and cover with their own syrup.","3694":"Put a pound of fine dried prunes in a saucepan; cover with water; place on the range to boil up a few times so they can soften, then drain and cover with a twenty-eight degree syrup, adding two or three slices of lemon, a small piece of cinnamon and a quarter of a bottleful of red wine. Place the saucepan on the fire and let the whole boil slowly until the prunes are done, then leave stand till cold and serve on a compote dish.","3695":"Pick some fine not too ripe strawberries or raspberries; cook some syrup to \"ball,\" throw in the berries and pour the whole at once carefully into a vessel to leave till cold. Drain and arrange on a compote dish; pour part of the syrup over and serve. Strawberry and Raspberry Jam. — Choose two pounds of sound, ripe strawberries or rasp- berries, remove the stalks and leaves. Either crush or pass them through a sieve. Have an un- tinned copper basin (Fig. 140), place the berries in it, reduce to half, remove the basin from the fire, then add a pound and a half of sugar cooked to \" small crack\" (No. 171). Put on the fire again, then stir continually until reduced sufficiently to see the bottom of the basin; now pour it in glasses or jars which have been heated; when the jam is cold cover with small rounds of paper, dipped in brandy, and close the jars or glasses hermetically and keep in a cool, dry place. 1058 THIi: EPICUREAN. SALTED ALMONDS, CHEESES AND FRESH FRUITS (Amandes Salees, Fromages et Fruits Frais),","3696":"Select fine, whole almonds, peel and lay them on a paper-covered baking sheet. Push this into a hot oven and when roasted to a fine golden brown throw them into a basin and sprinkle with a little water, slightly thickened with gum arabic, then dredge with very fine salt through a salt box having a perforated lid. Stir the almonds from time to time until dry, then leave to cool. Hazel-nuts, walnuts, and pistachios can also be salted; these are generally dressed in crimped paper cases or small fancy boxes; they are passed around with the desert, or at the same time as the hors d'ceuvre, and then left on the table during the entire length of the dinner. It is an improvement to mix these nuts and serve them together.","3697":"American, Brie, Camembert, Chester or Brighton, Cream, Briquebec, Eidam, Gorgonzola, Swiss or Gruyere, Holland, Munster, Mont-d'Or, Neufchatel, Parmesan, Pont Leveque, Port Salut, Roquefort, Stilton, Strachino, Shedder, Gervais. Cheese is served either after the roast, before the sweet entremets, or else with the dessert; the first is most appropriate. Cheese must be accompanied by crackers or very thin slices of toast; it should be cut in pieces or slices. At a dinner it is better to have two kinds handed to the guests, with fresh butter; serve salted almonds and nuts at the same time. Stilton must be served whole wrapped in a plaited napkin; it should be scooped out with a cheese spoon and each time it is used the vacuum should be filled with sherry wine; it must always be kept sufficiently damp to prevent cracking. Chester should be served the same as Stilton in a plaited napkin, after paring it neatly; it should also be cut with a spoon and filled each time with good Madeira wine. For Brie, Camembert, Mont-d'Or or Pont Leveque: scrape any of these cheeses and serve with a silver knife for each guest. For Roquefort and Gorgonzola carefully suppress the outer rinds and serve with silver knives; pass around at the same time some fresh butter. Strachino and Millanais are serve in a plaited napkin folded to resemble a tulip; scoop out with a cheese spoon the same as Stilton. Holland cheese should be cut in quarters or slices. Neufchatel should be scraped and served whole. Swiss cheese, Eidam, Munster, Port Salut and Briquebec are cut in slices. They must be chosen very mellow, cleaned and served with silver knives. Gervais is a sort of fresh bondon, the paste being very fine; it must be served quite cold. It should be covered with paper, to be removed when sending to the table.","3698":"Put two quarts of milk into a vessel and keep it in a cool place until it curdles, then pour this curdled milk on a hair sieve to drain, and pass it through the same sieve, standing over a deep vessel; add to it a little salt and half as much firmly beaten, unsweetened whipped cream. Take some heart-shaped tin molds, perforated with small holes, each mold one inch deep and three and a half inches long; line them with pieces of muslin and fill with the above; place these in the ice-box for two hours. When ready to serve invert on a plate, lift off the muslin and serve, accompanied by some thick and very cold cream.","3699":"Choose ripe fruits; arrange them either in baskets, fruit stands or plates garnished with green grape leaves and fresh moss. The base must be solid so that when carried they will not be dis- lodged; place the handsome part of the fruit on the outer side. Early fruits are always appre- ciated as they foretell those that are to follow in their season. Fruits for dressing are apricots, pineapples, pears, peaches, oranges, lady apples, grapes, cherries and strawberries. In case no fresh green leaves are procurable, use artificial ones made of muslin and dipped in wax. If a pine- apple is to be arranged in the center of a basket, stand it on a cardboard cylinder four inches high by thi'ee inches in diameter. All fruits to be found in New York are designated on the table for the different seasons (see page 17). Dry fruits consist of almonds, raisins, figs, dates, and innumer- able others. CONFECTIONERY. 1059 CHOCOLATE, COFFEES, KACAHOUT, TEAS, ETC, (Chocolat, Cafes, Bacahmt, Thes, Etc,","3700":"Have good, fine vanilla chocolate; dissolve it in a tin saucepan, or better still in a chocolate pan as shown in figure, using the mixer to dissolve it, over a slow fire, using a pound of chocolate for a quart of water. When well dissolved strain it through a fine FIG. 760. wire sieve and serve in a chocolate pot with a jug of hot water, and one of milk and sugar. Some persons prefer whipped cream in their chocolate. Serve brioches, grissinis, biscuits and other fancy breads. 761. same time","3701":"The best-known coffee-pot is the one with a filter, of which a design is shown (Fig. 762). They are to be had of various sizes and more or less luxurious. To obtain a limpid infusion quickly place the ground coffee in the cylinder on top of the coffee-pot, then put in the strainer on top of the coffee, press it down and pour boiling water over so that the infusion runs slowly down into the pot. While the infusion filters the coffee-pot should be kept in a vessel containing hot water to the depth of two fingers so that the infusion attains the same degree of heat without allowing it to boil. For the sake of economy, after the infusion is made, the grounds can be boiled up once more and an infusion prepared with it to take the place of plain water, but, in order to obtain a good result, the grounds must first settle, then the water be poured off, strained and heated to boiling point. In this way less coffee can be used without deteriorating from its excellence. Use one and a half pounds of Java coffee, a pound and a half of Maracaibo, one pound of Mocha and seven gallons of water. The best way to obtain good coffee is to make it only when required; the maxim should be \" little and often.\" It takes three kinds of coffee to obtain a good result; for instance, Mocha for the aroma, having it only slightly roasted, Maracaibo for the color, which should be well roasted, and Java for the strength, roasted to a degree between the other two.","3702":"To be made with the same proportion of Java as Mocha, ground and passed through a very fine sieve. Put ordinary black coffee in a coffee- pot, as many cups as needed, and add for each cup a common coffeespoonful of coffee passed through a sieve, also a lump of sugar; stand it on the fire or gas stove, boil for two minutes, then take it off and pour in a little cold water to settle the coffee; let stand again for a few minutes. Serve powdered sugar with the coffee. FIG. FIG. 783. FIG. 764. FIG. 765. FIG. 766.","3703":"Put a pint of milk into either a silver or tin saucepan. Place in a bowl two level spoonfuls of racahout, then four or five spoonfuls of cold milk; dissolve the racahout and pour it into the boiling milk; let cook for four or five minutes, stirring all the while, sweeten to taste and serve. It can also be prepared with water instead of milk. 1060 THE EPICUREAN.","3704":"Jilcwk Tea for Sixty -four Cups. — One pound of black tea and four gallons of water. Green Tea for Forty-eight Cups.— One pound of Oolong and green tea for three gallons of water. Slack Tea. — Put one ounce of black tea into a teapot; moisten it with two gills of boiling water to infuse and open the leaves and leave it thus for ten minutes, then add eight gills of boiling water. A few moments later stir with a teaspoon and let stand. Serve at the same time, sugar, cream, toast or cakes. Never allow utensils for tea-making to be used for any other purpose. The teapot should always be plunged in hot water before making the tea. For Green and Oolong. — Use an ounce and a half instead of an ounce and prepare it with the same quantity of water. Serve the tea on a tray covered with a cloth, accompanied by a sugar bowl, suger tongs, tea- spoons, cups and saucers, a pot of cream, boiling water, a teapot with a strainer, toast, fancy rolls, muffins, etc. For a party use the same preparation, only having the tea poured into cups. Russian Tea for Twelve Cups, Samovar. — The samovar is a brass or silver-plated urn having a cylinder in the center, with a grating at the bottom. Lay some paper in the cylinder, over place small splints of wood, and on these some charcoal. Light it from underneath and on the cylinder arrange a pipe that is then connected to the outside or the chimney. Fill the urn with water, between the cylinder and the outside; this part of the samovar is provided with a faucet. As soon as the water boils put the samovar on the table on a silver or brass salver. A crown is fastened to the center cylinder to infuse the tea and keep it hot. Put in twelve teaspoonfuls of the very best Oolong, Formosa or any other preferred brand of tea. Pour over three teacupfuls of boiling water and allow it to draw for five minutes, keeping it hermetically closed and very hot, then add nine more cupfuls of boiling water, and even more should the tea be too strong. Gentlemen are seldom present at afternoon teas. Serve the tea in cups, but for the evening (eight o'clock), tea is then poured into glasses for the gentlemen guests. These glasses are plain, four inches high, three inches wide on top and two inches at the bottom; they are to be placed in silver or silvered glass holders, having handles; the ladies' tea is served in cups. Cream must be handed around at the same time, also very thin slices of lemon in crystal dishes, accompanied by small silver forks. Strawberry or raspberry jam, rose or currant jelly flavored with vanilla, according to taste, very thin slices of buttered bread, dry sweet tea cakes and sugar broken into pieces the size of a currant may also be served with the tea. WINES (Vina).","3705":"Grimod de la Keyniere has said that \" No one ages at table; \" he might have added, when the dinner is good and the wines are of the finest. Wine is the intellectual part of the meal and is to be served at a proper temperature in the order of the service, as will be explained further on. However, this is not an absolute rule; preference should be given to such and such a wine accord- ing to one's taste and according also to the influence it bears on one's health. This last point is easier to define for there can be no rule given regarding taste, as each individual sensation is apt to differ. Some prefer the keen savor of Bordeaux, others the delicate aroma of champagne; this one the warmth of the wines from Languedoc; another the exciting flavor of Burgundy. Tastes, for some reason or other, are formed on temperament; nature indicates and inspires in its very best way the proper method to follow for the good of our health. Sanguine temperaments feel the want of a light wine, such as champagne and Rhine wines; the phlegmatically inclined love the warmth of spirits, and the wines from Languedoc and Frontignon; gloomy dispositions crave for sweet Spanish, Italian, Boussillon and Burgundy wines; and those of a bilious nature, absorbed by the contention of their daily physical pain, require a stimulating wine such, as Bordeaux. Bordeaux wine is generous, stomachic, easily digested, leaves the mouth clear and the head free, even when liberally drank. This wine can be transported to a great distance. Burgundy wine is aphrodaisical; it is extremely delicate and of a delightful aroma. Champagne wines are heady; they are limpid, light, odorous and unctuous. When champagne is frozen its effect is entirely changed; the temperature of the ice increases its tonic power and better contributes to the act of digestion, it condenses on the stomach and prevents the largest proportion from stimulating and rising to the brain. Frequently dinner parties are given when champagne alone is served. Cham- pagne is not a natural wine, for on its preparation depends the superior qualities it is required to possess. Khine wines are liked for the delightful mellowness of their flavor. They can support very long journeys, which instead of deteriorating only increases their value. The Cellar. — Be very careful that the cellar is not exposed to sudden vibrations or shocks, or they will cause the lightest part of the dregs to arise, and when this mingles with the wine it pro- duces sourness; also avoid placing any green wood in the cellar when the sap is ascending, or any vegetables, for these produce fermentation, impair the quality of the wine and prevent its pres- ervation. Cellars should be kept very clean and at a temperature of 50 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit, without any thorough draught. In the warmest part of the cellar place the Bordeaux, and the Burgundy in the coldest. Placing the Casks in the Cellar. — Before a cask of wine is placed in the cellar it should be thoroughly examined to see whether it be in good condition and the hoops perfectly solid. Stand the casks on wooden joists six to eight inches square, placed on bricks high enough so that a bot- tle can be set under the faucet; when in this position wedge each one separately with blocks of wood and be careful not to move or disturb the casks. When wines are required to be left in their barrels they should be placed sufficiently far apart to allow a free circulation between. Should the wines be of the present year the cask should be bored near the bung and the hole closed by a small plug removed from time to time so that the fermentation can be known. If, when the plug is taken out, the air comes whistling forth, then fermentation still exists; in this case remove the plug daily and at less frequent intervals as fermentation diminishes. Casks should always be refilled as quickly as they are emptied. Light wines spoil easily if their casks are not kept con- stantly full. The drier and more airy is the cellar the faster the barrels must be refilled. This should be done every month, and the wine used for refilling should be of exactly the same quality as that already contained therein; this alone will prevent it from deteriorating. (1061) 1062 THE EPICUREAN.","3706":"The faucet should be partly opened to allow sufficient time for corking the bottles that have been removed. The corks should be selected perfectly sound, especially if to be kept for a long while. Dip them first in lukewarm water and force them into the bottle with a mallet or a special machine, then cut them off leaving an eighth of an inch above the bottle. Wines are bottled to have them attain the ripeness to which they are susceptible and to be able to keep them in a better condition; generally it requires two years before bottling red wines; only do so when they are found to be of a proper degree and ripeness, neither too sweet nor too sour, but of a perfect and pure flavor. White wine can be bottled earlier than red — one year to eighteen months, after it has lost its sweet taste. The clearness of a wine being one of its most essential points, an effort should be made to obtain this result; if not of a perfect limpidity, then wait a few days longer, and if not then clear it must be drawn off and transferred to another very clean cask, and clarified over again. Bottles must be rinsed carefully with lead shot or small pebbles. Bottle the wine on a clear, cold day; avoid stormy weather, and if possible select a day when the wind blows from the northeast. Bore the cask with a gimlet at an inch and a half from the inside border and stop as soon as the wine appears, then push in the opened faucet and strike it in such a way as not to disturb the dregs. The spigot must be left sufficiently open to allow enough time for filling the bottles while the corks are being put in. If required for keeping, then cover the cork and about an inch and a half of the neck of the bottle with some prepared wax, by dipping it in the heated wax and rotating the bottle until the adhering wax is cold; this coating keeps the corks from molding and from being eaten up by insects. To make this wax melt a pound of common rosin with two ounces of yellow wax and half an ounce of mutton tallow; color it with animal black, ochre, etc.; if too brittle add more tallow, and if the opposite, then more rosin. The bottles are to be stacked slightly inclined so that the wine can touch the cork at all times. The above is an abridged direction on preparing and bottling wines. The utensils needed are: one large funnel, two measures of three gallons each, a faucet for drawing off the wine and one other one, a mallet to push in the corks, a beater for the bung-hole in the cask, a pump and a felt filter, or round paper filters, for filtering the wine from the bottom of the cask.","3707":"Clarifying is not only for the purpose of rendering wines clear, but also to free them of any dissoluble matter which might precipitate later. To Clarify Red Wines. — To clarify a cask of wine containing two hundred and twenty-five quarts, beat up partly five egg-whites with half a bottleful of wine; take out eight quarts of wine from the cask, pour in the clarifying matter and insert a stick split in four; move this about in every direction for two minutes so as to mix in the whites well, then refill the cask with the eight quarts previously extracted, and finish filling with wine or water; put back the bung. Five or six days after the wine should be clear, but in case it is not sufficiently so draw all the wine off into another very clean cask and reclarify once more the same as before, leaving it five or six days; it can then be drawn. To Clarify White Wines. — White wines are clarified with fish isinglass. Beat with a hammer a quarter of an ounce of the isinglass, tear it to pieces, cutting it apart with a pair of scissors, then soak it for eight hours in sufficient wine to cover; when swollen, and it has absorbed all the liquid, pour over as much as before and leave it for twenty-four hours; then add half a pint of hot water; stir this about to crush, then press forcibly through a towel. Beat it with a whip, pour- ing a little white wine slowly over until the entire solution makes one quart of liquid. Before pouring it into the cask beat it up with three pints of white wine and finish the same as the red. The egg-whites or isinglass can be replaced by prepared powders.","3708":"Decanting consists of gently pouring from the bottles, inclining them slightly, any liquor that leaves a sediment; on this depends the clear appearance of an old wine. Well-decantered liquors present a beautiful limpid color through the decanter, contributing greatly to the enjoyment of drinking a glass of good wine. Basket for Serving Wines. — In well-appointed houses the fine wines are decantered before dinner and poured into cut-glass decanters. A simpler way is to lay the bottles in \"WINES. 1063 a small wicker basket, fastening them in with two strings; but in order to carry out this precaution it will be absolutely necessary to have the bottle laid in the basket several hours before putting it FIG. 767. on the table, so that however little sediment the wine may contain it will settle at the bottom of the bottle. It is unnecessary to add that the basket must not be violently shaken and that the wine be poured out with the greatest care.","3709":"Absinthe. Vermouth. SHERRY. From the De Renne Estate.

Have a pail made of galvanized sheet iron or of wood, but the iron one is preferable, for the wine cools quicker in it. Put the bottle into a pail thirteen inches deep, seven and a half inches in diameter at the bottom and nine inches at the top; this pail must be furnished with a handle. Make a mixture of three FIG. FIG. 769. pounds of finely pounded ice with a pound and a half of rock salt, not too coarse: fill the pail to the top, mix well together and turn the bottle by the neck to give it a backward and forward move- ment from right to left. If the champagne be taken from the ice-box where it has been lying for several hours, then it will only take twelve to fourteen minutes to freeze, but if it has not been previously on ice, then it will require fifteen to eighteen minutes for the operation. Champagne can be frozen without turning it around by leaving it in the salted ice for half an hour before serv- ing. Machines are sometimes used which simplify the work greatly; the same time is required, only the labor is less fatiguing. When finished serve in a metal silver-plated pail with salted ice around. These are to be placed either on the table or on a small side table.","3711":"Iced drinks are those to which plenty of ice is added, then covered with a tin shaker and shaken until the contents are very cold and iced. Cold drinks are those mixed into chopped ice with a spoon. A glass of vermuth equals half a gill and is the glass meant in the recipes when not otherwise specified. Five small glassfuls equal a gilL Six dashes fill a teaspoon. Vermuth Cocktail. — Put some fine ice into a large glass, add a glassful of Italian vermuth and one dash of Boker's bitters; mix the whole together with a spoon, strain and serve in small glasses. Another kind of vermuth cocktail is made by replacing the Italian vermuth by French vermuth, and having orange bitters instead of Boker's. Sherry and Bitters. — Sherry into which a little bitters is mixed. Brandy, Whiskey, Holland Gin and Tom Gin Cocktails. — Put some very finely broken ice in a large glass, add a glassful either of brandy, whiskey or Holland gin, one dash of Boker's bitters, 1066 THE EPICUREAN. and two dashes of sweetening (gum syrup); mix well together with a spoon, strain and serve in small glasses. Tom gin cocktail is made exactly the same, only using old Tom gin and suppressing the sweetening. Calisaya Cocktail.— Mix in a large glass some finely chopped ice, a vermuth glassful of calisaya, one dash of orange bitters and a little vermuth; mix well, strain and serve in small glasses. Peruvian Cocktail. — Add to some finely chopped ice in a glass, a vermuth glassful of Peruvian bitters, one dash of orange bitters and a little vermuth; mix thoroughly, strain and serve in small glasses. Martine Cocktail. — Have some broken ice in a large glass with the third of a glassful of Tom gin and two-thirds (making a glassful in all) of vermuth, and one dash of Boker's bitters; mix well, strain and pour into small glasses. Manhattan Cocktail. — Place some very finely broken ice in a large glass, add the third of a glassful of whiskey and two-thirds of vermuth, also one dash of Boker's bitters; mix properly, strain and serve in small glasses. Jersey Cocktail Iced. — For three cocktails put into a vermuth glass some apple jack and two glassf uls of Italian or French vermuth, adding three dashes of Angostura bitters and finely pounded ice. Cover with a tin shaker, toss, strain and pour into small glasses. Absinthe Cocktail Iced. — Put some finely chopped ice in a large glass, add a small glassful of absinthe, two dashes of orange bitters and two dashes of sweetening; mix properly, cover with a shaker, toss, strain and serve in small glasses. Iced Absinthe. — Have some finely chopped ice in a large glass, add a small glassful of absinthe and water, cover with a tin shaker, toss thoroughly, strain and serve in medium-sized glasses. Riding Club Cocktail. — Put some finely broken ice in a glass with two-thirds of a glass of Hostetter's bitters, half a teaspoonful cf Horsford's acid phosphate, two dashes of French vermuth; cover with a tin shaker and toss until the cocktail is iced, then strain and pour into small glasses. For all cocktails a piece of lemon peel is generally twisted over the cocktail.","3712":"Sweeten a pint of claret to taste, add to it one gill of maraschino or Ouragoa, one pint of soda water, a few mint leaves, fresh strawberries or raspberries and pieces of pineapple. Cucumbers or borage leaves may be added. A la Willard's. — Crush one pound of strawberries, add four spoonfuls of powdered sugar, the juice of one lemon, a pint of whipped cream and a bottleful of soda water.","3713":"Lemonade. — Take a pint and a half of lemon juice and a pound and a half of sugar, add water to taste, add thin slices of lemon and serve very cold. Lemonade with Syrup. — Ten gills of syrup at thirty-two degrees, one quart of lemon juice, the peel of one lemon and a quart of water; let the peel infuse, strain through a silk sieve and bring it to eleven degrees, syrup gauge (Fig. 167). Orangeade. — Eight gills of syrup at thirty -two degrees, ten gills of lemon juice, the peel of two oranges, two and a half quarts of water, and the juice of four lemons; bring it to eleven degrees, syrup gauge, strain through a silk sieve and serve very cold.","3714":"CLARET AND EUM PUNCH; DESSERT DEINKS (Punch au Champagne, Bordeaux et Ehum; Boissons Pour le Dessert). Champagne. — Three quarts of champagne wine, two quarts or bottles of Sauterne wine, three bottles of soda water, one gill of Curacoa and fresh fruits in season. Claret. — Four bottles of Bordeaux, one quart of water, one pound of sugar, one gill of Curacoa and kirsch, half of each, half a gill of lemon juice and fresh fruits in season, such as cherries, strawberries, pineapple or raspberries. Rum. — Two quarts of St. Croix rum, one pint of Jamaica rum, three pints of water, one pound of sugar, one gill of lemon juice and fresh fruits in season. WINES. 1067 A delicious drink is currant juice, grenadine or orgeat, in large glasses, and moistened with ice cold water. Dessert Drinks. — Fine champagne brandy, iced eckau kummel, iced cream of peppermint (creme de menthe), Chartreuse, yellow and green, and kirsch. Pousse Cafe. — The pousse cafe is a drink composed of four kinds of liquor of different color; that is to say, white cream of peppermint, green Chartreuse, cream of cocoa and brandy. These four liquors are poured into a glass tumbler in such a way that they remain in distinct layers, which is done by carefully pouring the above liquors, one after the other, against the side of the glass; thus the liquors flow down gently without mixing. (3715), CLAUDIUS PUNCH AND WINE PUNCH— HOT (Punch Claudius et Punch au Yin Chaud). To one pound of Scotch oatmeal mix four quarts of boiling water; whip it in, stirring vigor- ously; then boil the preparation, working it steadily; add one and a half pounds of seeded Malaga raisins, the peel and juice of four lemons, a pint of good sherry wine and sufficient sugar to sweeten, a little grated nutmeg, ground cloves and cinnamon; also add a quarter of a pound of finely shredded citron, and should it be too thick then put in more boiling water, strain through a fine sieve, let cool and serve. Wine Punch— Hot. — Put into a jar two bottles of Bordeaux wine, the juice of six oranges and the peel of three, a small stick of cinnamon, and three cloves; let the whole infuse for twelve hours, then pass through a sieve. Put the liquid in an untinned copper saucepan with six ounces of sugar; heat until it nearly reaches the boiling point and serve in punch glasses. ADDITIONAL RECIPES. CENTURY TABLES. Following will be found several plates taken from works of the last century. I have thought them sufficiently interesting to publish and even to have them made use of, that is by modifying the models; for instance, replacing the colored sand beds by those of arabesques of flowers or grass; the marble statues by bronzes, the trees by graceful potted plants and the center by hand- some ornamental sugar pieces. The following cuts will give a correct idea of how these tables were dressed. The center of the table was decorated with \"dormants\" or looking-glass platforms; on these were placed ornaments made by cutting out cardboard arabesques (see plate 1). The edges of these cardboards were trimmed with green chenille fastened on with green wax; this chenille filled up any vacant space that might occur between the cardboard and the looking-glass. The center B is decorated with a balustrade shown in the design on the top of the page. The center of this is a square flower-bed, in the middle of which a figure generally stood, and the remainder of the bed is decorated around with variegated colored sand; to meet this balustrade is a gum-paste border garnished with small fancy cakes or dried fruits. There must always be a space two feet wide left between the platform and the edge of the table. The designs A and C are decorated with beds the same as B, having also a figure in the center. In case of large tables these \" dormants\" or platforms were made in sections. PLATE II. — Represents a table already dressed, taken from a work published in 1768. PLATE III. — A table laid with the dessert, decorated with colored sand arabesques. PLATE IV. — Represents a more modern horseshoe-shaped table; this design being frequently used for large society dinners and banquets. This form of table is very convenient, as the president is seated in the center of the rounded part and the two principal officers at the ends; on the right of the president, the most honored guest; on his left, the one next in distinction and so on, alter- nating from right to left for the guests or members of the society. No high center pieces or other tall ornaments should be placed before the president, merely a basket of natural flowers or one of pulled sugar flowers. On the length of the table and in the center or middle line can be placed several high pieces, candelabras, epergnes, etc. , all around, sixteen inches from the edge. Arrange the plates and glassware at the usual distances, with two forks on the left, one for fish and another for the entrees; on the right have a knife, a soupspoon, a butter knife and an oyster fork, butter and salt in front, and around arrange the glasses for water, Burgundy, port, champagne, Sauterne, and sherry. The space between each place is twenty-four inches for those seated straight and twenty-two for those on the curve. Before each plate set a chair and on the plate a folded napkin containing a roll; in front a card with the number and name written on of the person who is to occupy the seat. This is a short synopsis of the manner of arranging a horseshoe-shaped table. PLATE V. — Represents divers ornaments used for decorating a table the same as Plate I. The design D represents the palace of Circe, who metamorphized Ulysses' companions into swine. E F are statues to stand at each end; G are pedestals with vases on top; placed around the beds of sand or flowers and between each pedestal is a tree as shown in H. The looking-glass u dor- mant \" or platform can be left undecorated. M may be used instead of the temple for a small table. PLATE VI.— -Figure No. 1 represents a border around the dormant made of gum paste; No. 2 platforms to place the dried fruits and nuts on; No. 3 flower beds; No. 4 the position for the trees; No. 5 for pedestals having grass around each one; No. 6 represents mounds of earth to stand figures on, and all the intervening empty space is to be of looking-glass, or else of sand, according to taste.
