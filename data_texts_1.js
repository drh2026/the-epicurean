var TEXTS_CHUNK_1={"186":"First. — Select the freshest meats procurable; do not wash, but remove all that is not of the very freshest; bone and tie up each piece separately leaving them as large as possible; split the bones and put them into a soup-pot with cold water and the meat. Second. — Heat and boil it up slowly to give the albumen time to dissolve in the liquid; it coagulates as soon as the liquid reaches one hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit, and rising to the surface brings with it all the impurities contained therein, which is called scum. Third. — Carefully remove this scum as quickly as it rises to the surface, and before the liquid boils, for after that the scum partly dissolves and the rest of it precipitates and destroys the transparency of the broth. \"When the broth is well skimmed, add salt, allspice, and vegetables; then keep it boiling as continuously and slowly as possible to prevent too much evaporation.","187":"There is nothing that resembles consommé more than clarified bouillon, and if it does not entirely take its place as regards quality, still it is often used instead. Clarified bouillon is in reality only an imitation of consomme, it is equally true that with care it can easily be prepared in excellent conditions, the principal one being to operate with good bouillon, either of chicken, beef or game, etc. To obtain clear bouillon, only lean meats must be used for clarification: in order to obtain four quarts of bouillon, have one pound of lean beef free of all fat and nerves, chop it finely, and mix in with it, two raw eggs and one pint of cold bouillon; place the strained bouillon on the fire, skimmed free of all its fat, and when it reaches boiling point, pour into it the clarification, beating it well with a whip. As soon as the bouillon boils, keep it to the same degree of heat without allowing it to boil, for one hour; skim the fat off, season with salt and a little  sugar, and color it with caramel (No. 18), then remove and strain through a wet napkin stretched and fastened to the four legs of a kitchen stool (Fig. 99), or else a silk sieve. These bouillons are to be served with garnishings of Italian pastes and farinas, also garnishings of vegetables, etc., for various soups.","188":"Have ten quarts of water in a soup pot; add to it three pounds of knuckle of veal, and trimmings, seven pounds of very fresh poultry. Boil, skim, and put in three quarters of a pound of carrots, half a pound of turnips, twelve ounces of leeks, two onions, one stuck with two cloves, two ounces of celery, one ounce of parsley roots, two bay leaves, salt/sixty grains of whole peppers; boil slowly and continuously for four nours, then strain through a silk sieve. If needed in a great hurry, boil six quarts of ordinary stock, have two fowls of three pounds each, after removing the breasts, chop the remainder of the fowls coarsely, put them in the stock, add four ounces of minced carrots and six ounces of leeks also minced, boil slowly for one hour; skim off the fat, season with salt, strain through a fine sieve or moistened napkin, and serve. The breasts are used for forcemeat or to clarify broth.","189":"Proportions. — When the stock (No. 194a) is ready put five quarts of it into a soup pot, adding two pounds of lean meat and three pounds of cleansed and washed fowls. Boil it up slowly, and just when ready to come to a boil, carefully remove the scum arising on the surface and then add half a pound of roasted veal. Simmer slowly until the fowl is cooked, which will take from two and a half to three hours, lifting it out as soon as it is done so as to save the breasts which will be found useful for garnishings, purees, salads, sandwiches, etc. ; return what remains of the fowls to the broth once again and continue boiling for half an hour longer, skim the fat off very carefully and mix in the clarification. Clarification. —Trim off the fat, remove the nerves from a piece of beef sufficient to obtain two pounds after it is chopped up, and mix in with this chopped meat half a quart of cold stock (or water) ; pour this clarification into the broth, add two ounces of minced carrots, and two ounces of minced leeks; season with salt and color the soup with caramel (No. 18); keep the liquid in a boiling state for one hour. The consomme should be perfectly clear, sapid and tasty; strain it through a silk sieve or a fine napkin and use when needed, serve in cups, or in a soup tureen with any garnishing desired. Remoistening . — After the stock or consomme has been taken out of the pot, pour in sufficient water to have the meats entirely re-covered and boil again for three hours; remove all the fat and strain it through a napkin; do not salt this. This remoistening is used for diluting certain soups, and to moisten veal or chicken stock with which meat extract is made (see meat extract, No. 368).","190":"add two pounds of knuckle of veal, one pound of chicken legs and pinions, then boil, skim, and put in four pounds of roasted, unbrowned chicken, two minced leeks, one medium sized minced carrot, one onion stuck with one clove, a little parsley and celery roots. Boil continually for four hours. Chop up very fine two pounds of veal, mix in with it two whole eggs, dilute with one quart of cold broth and stir this into the consomme, using a whip, adding two broken up chicken carcasses. Boil on a slow fire for one hour, salt it according to taste, and strain it through a silk sieve.","191":"OLABIFIED GAME CONSOMMÉ' (Consommé de Gibier Clarine\"), Butter the inside of a very thick saucepan, cover the bottom with sliced onions, and lay on top three pounds of broken knuckle of veal and eight pounds of game, such as partridges, quails, pheasants and young rabbit, also half a pound of legs and pinions or bits of poultry, moisten with a pint of stock, place it on a moderate fire, and cover the saucepan; let steam and fall to a glaze, then dilute with half bottle of white wine, and ten quarts of stock or water. Boil, then skim and season with salt and two pepper corns for each quart of liquid, two cloves, also half a pound of carrots, one ounce of parsley roots, half a pound of leeks, two ounces of celery, the whole minced. Kemove all the bones from two very fresh young rabbits; put these in with the stock and boil all for four hours; strain through a sieve and put it back into the saucepan; chop up fine the flesh from the rabbits with as much lean beef meat, mix in with it two whole eggs and dilute with half a bottleful of white wine. Skim off all the fat from the broth and stir in the chopped rabbits, continuing stirring for one minute, then let come to a boil, move it from the hot fire, and boil slowly and unceasingly for one half hour more; after the consomme is very clear, strain it through a silk sieve or through a napkin.","193":"BEEF STOCK OR BROTH (Bouillon de Bceuf). Proportion of Ingredients. — Ten quarts of water, a quarter of a pound of chicken legs, one and one quarter ounces of salt, six ounces of leeks, half ounce of soup celery, eight pounds of meat with bone, twenty grains or cloves of black pepper, six ounces of carrots, one half ounce of parsnip, one half clove of garlic (if desired), two whole cloves, three ounces turnips, four ounces of onions, one of which stuck with two cloves. Put ten quarts of water into a stockpot, add eight pounds of beef meat (trimmings and bone), let there be at least two-thirds meat, being careful to have both meat and trimmings well freed of fat; and a quarter of a pound of scalded chicken legs, after removing the outer skin. Heat this up slowly so that it comes gradually to a boil, then skim carefully and add twenty grains of whole black peppers and one and one quarter ounces of salt. Put into a net six ounces of carrots, three ounces of turnips, six ounces of leeks, half an ounce of parsnips, one half an ounce of soup celery, and two ounces of onions in which two cloves should be stuck. Close the net and set it in the pot; after the vegetables have cooked for two hours, remove the net containing the vegetables and continue boiling the soup for two hours longer, making four hours in all. Take off all the fat from the surface and strain the soup either through a silk tammy or a napkin; pour it into another pot to make consomme; and in case it should be needed the following day only, pour it into vessels and set it to cool; the following is an economical way of doing so: set the vessels in a water reservoir supplied continually with cold water from melting ice in the refrigerators and brought through a pipe in the bottom of the tank, have a larger overflow pipe placed near the top so as to allow the water as it heats to flow off. (194b). PARTS OF BEEF USED FOR PREPARING BOUILLONS AND STOCKS, SEE FIG. 302 (Parties du Bceuf Servant a Faire les Bouillons et les Fonds, Voir Fig. 302). These various pieces are No. 2, the cheek jowl; No. 3, the neck: No. 4, the brisket; No. 5, the cross-ribs; No. 6, the shin; No. 8, the plate; No. 9, the navel; No. 10, the inside flank; No. 11, the thick flank; No. 17, the round bottom; No. 18, the leg. The shin is the bottom part of the hind quarter the nearest to the ankle bone. The gelatinous flesh of the shin renders it suitable for the preparation of stock, broths and jellies. ","195":"In order to make thick stock use consomme of game, vegetables, fish or chicken before they are clarified. Place half a pound of butter in a saucepan with half a pound of sifted flour of the best quality, let cook well on a slow fire without coloring when needed for vegetables, fish or chicken, but for game make a brown roux; for either one or the other dilute this roux with boiling broth (if the soup should be a chicken soup, chicken broth should be used to dilute the roux, if game soup then game broth should be used, fish with fish broth, for vegetable, vegetable broth). Use a whisk turning it rapidly, so as to avoid having lumps; stocks for soups should be kept rather thin, that is to say but little thickened and should be well despumated, the fat removed before passing through the tammy; return the saucepan to the fire, and stir continuously with a spatula from the bottom until the broth boils. Remove the saucepan and place it so that only one side of the contents cook slowly for one hour; skim and take off all the matter that swims on the sur- face until the stock be entirely free from fat, and other impurities floating on top arising from the clarification, then strain through a tammy or fine sieve, and use this stock for thick soups either of game, vegetables, fish or poultry.","196":"An exquisite and delicious bisque. The ancient bisques made between the years 1700 and 1750, differed greatly from our modern bisques. They were more like stews than soups or potages and were prepared with squabs, quails, pullets and fish, the crawfish only serving as a garnish, and were basted over with a crawfish gravy. Bisques as they are made to-day, are simply a puree, thickened with rice, or thick stock, or wet crusts and accompanied by various garnishings. Bisques are divided into five classes: First, those made of clams, oysters or mussels; Second, crabs; Third, shrimps, Fourth, crawfish; Fifth, lobsters. They must be highly seasoned, although not containing much red pepper, rather clear than thick, slightly colored, and accompanied by small, simple garnishings.","197":"Put sixty medium-sized opened clams into a pan, with their own juice; set it on the fire, and when they are very firm to the touch drain and pound the clams with their equal weight of cooked hominy; after all is well pounded and reduced to a paste, wet it with the clam juice poured off gently from the top, and some water in case the bisque be too thick, then pass it through a sieve or tammy and season with red pepper and very little salt if necessary, warm the bisque without boiling it, and just when ready to serve incorporate therein some fine butter and a little cream, garnish with sippets of bread fried in butter and some small pike quenelles (No. 90).","198":"Put twenty-four live crabs in cold water with a little salt, and leave them to soak for one hour, mince four ounces of carrot and the same quantity of onion, fry them in butter in a saucepan sufficiently large to contain all the crabs, add some parsley sprigs, thyme and bay leaf, season with salt, half a bottle of white wine and some white stock, then cover and cook for fifteen minutes: lift out the crabs, strain the broth, and set it aside to rest, pouring off the top twenty-five minutes later. Remove the shells from the crabs; pick out the lungs from both sides, wash each one separately in tepid water and suppress the small legs, then drain well and pound them to a paste with half their quantity of cooked rice, dilute this puree with some of the juice they were cooked in, drain through a sieve and then a tammy and mix in one pint of bechamel (No. 409). Season with salt and red pepper, heat up without boiling and just when ready to serve, incorporate therein a quarter of a pound of fine butter, stirring it well with a spoon until it be completely melted. Pour the very hot bisque into a soup tureen and serve separately a garnishing of pieces of bread cut into one quarter of an inch squares and fried in butter; divide them by putting six or eight in each separate soup-plate when serving.","199":"Wash twenty-four live crabs in several waters; then drain them, fry half a pound minced onions in butter, adding a quarter of a pound of rice flour and then the crabs; moisten with half a 244 THE EPICUREAN. bottleful of white wine and two quarts of broth; cook slowly in a covered saucepan for fifteen minutes, then lift out the crabs only, and strain the broth into another vessel, and leave it to deposit its sediment. Remove the large shells from the crabs, also the small legs and lungs, then wash the crabs well in warm water, moving them around in the pan so as to free them of all adhering sand; after draining them well, pound them in a mortar with the addition of a little butter; moisten them with the decanted stock and some other broth, should it be too thick; strain through a sieve or tammy, and return them to the saucepan. Heat to a boiling degree without actually letting it boil, warm it, then add some egg-yolks, cream and fine butter; strain again through a tammy and serve the soup very hot with crusts of bread cut dice shaped, a quarter of an inch in size.","200":"Prepare and cook the crabs the same as for bisque of crabs (No. 198), have one pound of onions, cut them in halves through the center of the root and stalk, remove from each side of the halved onion, and on the bias, one quarter of an inch of the root and stalk; mince this up very fine, blanch, then drain and fry the pieces in butter, moistening them with one part of cream. Pound well the crabs to reduce them to a paste and add six quarts of oatmeal previously cooked for thirty minutes in one quart of water. Add the onions, and when all is well mingled together, increase the quantity of bisque with thedecanted crab juice and more broth, if the puree be too thick; strain through a sieve or tammy, return it to the fire, and heat it without boiling, and just when ready to serve, stir in a quarter of a pound of fresh butter. Pour the soup into a very hot soup tureen and add a garnishing of crescent shaped quenelles, made of sweet potatoes (No. 317).","201":"Wash in several waters four dozen crawfish after removing the fins, the same as for bisque Persigny (No. 204); put the crawfish into a saucepan, pouring over half a bottleful of white wine, four ounces of minced onions, the same quantity of finely minced carrots, a few sprigs of parsley, one bay leaf, as much thyme, salt, mignonette, a little red pepper and half a pint of broth; cook all together for ten minutes with the cover on, tossing them several times in the meanwhile, then take them from off the fire and leave them standing for ten minutes longer in their broth; pour them into a colander to drain, and afterward select half of the finest, medium and equal sized ones; remove the tail ends from these, and the shells, and keep the meats aside for the garnishing, also half of the finest, but smallest shells from the head; stuff these with a red pike forcemeat finished with crawfish butter (for this see crawfish butter, No. 573), and with the remainder of the crawfish and the frag- ments make a bisque, pounding them with their equal quantity of rice; when all is well pounded, moisten with the broth they were cooked in and more plain broth, then strain through a sieve and a tammy. Warm it well without boiling, and incorporate into it when ready to serve, a piece of crawfish butter; pour the soup into the tureen and garnish with the tails and bodies both cut lengthwise in two. Crawfish bisque should be colored slightly more than the shrimp bisque. Use for coloring bisques some orchanet warmed in clarified butter or any other greasy substance, or clear vegetal carmine. Breton makes an excellent coloring for bisques.","202":"wash forty-eight crawfish in several waters, drain them, mince some carrots, leeks, onions and celery root, fry them in butter and just on the eve of browning, mix in a quarter of a pound of flour; cook the flour for a few minutes, and then add the crawfish, some sprigs of parsley, two bay leaves, salt and mignonette, cover the saucepan and cook for fifteen minutes, tossing them several times, then drain. Pick out the meat from the tails, cut them in two and reserve them for the garnish- ing: pound the shells as well as the claws with twelve hard boiled egg-yolks, and when a good paste is obtained, moisten it with the thick stock, strained first through a sieve not too fine, and after- ward through a tammy; moisten again with fat or lean broth. Should the bisque be required for a lean dinner; warm it up without boiling and incorporate in half a pound of crawfish butter with cayenne and half a gill of Madeira wine. Set the crawfish tails into a soup tureen and pour the bisque over, and when serving the soup put into each plate six pieces of bread a quarter of an inch square, fried in butter.  (203). BISQUE OF CRAWFISH 1 LA HUMBOLDT (Bisque d'Ecrevisses a la Humboldt). Wash thoroughly in several waters, four dozen crawfish, after removing the fins from the middle of the tail (see bisque Persigny, No. 204), drain them, then fry in butter, some carrots, onions, leeks, celery and parsley roots all cut into small squares; moisten with half a bottleful of Rhine wine, the same quantity of broth, and season with salt, mignonette and cayenne, and a gill of tomato puree (No. 730), put this with the crawfish on the fire in a well covered saucepan and cook for fifteen minutes, tossing them frequently while cooking; then drain them, and pick out the meat from the tails. Pound the shells with double their quantity of rice and when all forms a paste, moisten with the broth strained through a fine sieve; season and warm up without boiling, and when ready to serve, mix in a quarter of a pound of crawfish butter. Place the crawfish tails with small pancakes, cut round, five-eighths of an inch in diameter, in the soup tureen and pour the bisque over. (204). BISQUE OF CRAWFISH A LA PERSIGffY (Bisque d'Ecrevisses a la Persigny). Remove the small black vein found in the center of the tail from forty-eight crawfish, using for this purpose either the tip of a knife, or else by twisting it round to the right, and pulling the fin away from the middle of the tail, and the vein attached to this will come off at the same time; it is most necessary to abstract this as it is always filled with sand. Wash the crawfish well; put them into a saucepan with a pint of broth, and the same quantity of white wine, salt, black pepper, two ounces of butter, two minced shallots, parsley and bay-leaf; boil for fifteen minutes, then drain and empty the bodies of twelve of the finest among them; pound the others to a fine paste, adding one quart of veloute\" sauce (No. 415), and one quart of broth; let boil again for fifteen minutes, then add to the bisque, half a pound of sliced bread, buttered and browned in the oven; simnver for fifteen minutes longer; then strain first through a sieve, and then through a tammy. Heat it up once more, and just when ready to serve, incorporate into it a quarter of a pound of fine buttev, with a little red pepper added; fill the empty bodies with chicken force:neat (No. 62) and lobster OR crawfish butter mixed; poach them in boiling water, and when done cut them lengthwise in twor have also a garnishing of crusts made with savarin, a quarter of an inch square, dried in the oven, and served separate.","205":"Plunge into boiling, salted water, twelve pounds of small, live, well washed lobsters; cook them for twenty-five minutes, then drain; break their shells, and extract all the meat. Pound the lobster meat with its equal quantity of boiled rice; season with salt and red pepper, then dilute it with fat broth or lean, should the bisque be desired lean, strain through a sieve, and again through a tammy. Heat it up without allowing it to boil, add a pint of bechamel (No. 409), and half a pound of lobster butter (No. 580); stir well the bisque until the butter is thoroughly melted. Color a lobster bisque a deeper red than the crawfish. Crusts of brioche, a quarter of an inch square, and dried in the oven may be served at the same time.","206":"Mince very fine one medium carrots, one leek and two onions, fry them in butter and moisten with fat broth, or lean, some parsley sprigs, thyme, bay leaf, garlic, salt and black pepper. At the first boil, put in with this, twelve pounds of raw, live, and washed lobsters, continue to boil for thirty minutes, then drain them, break the shells, remove all the meat, reserve that from the claws, and pound the remainder with its equal quantity of wheaten grits. Make a light roux with four ounces of butter and five ounces of flour, moisten it with some of the broth the lobsters were cooked in, boil, skim, add this to the lobster preparation. Heat it up all together, then strain through a sieve and afterward through a tammy, warm it up again and just when ready to serve and very hot, stir into the bisque a piece of lobster butter (No. 580), and a quart of double cream. Put a garnishing into the soup tureen and pour the soup over; serve as a garnishing the lobster meat from the claws cut into small Julienne (No. 318), and small cream forcemeat quenelles, laid through a cornet on a buttered tin, \"and poached in a little boiling water.","207":"Select twelve pounds of small, live lobsters, eight of them in all; remove the claws and cook them apart in boiling, salted water for twenty-five minutes. Cut in slices crosswise the remainder of the lobsters, fry these pieces in butter on a hot fire, adding four tablespoonfuls of flour; when -246 THE EPICUREAN. slightly colored, moisten with half a bottleful of white wine and two and a half quarts of broth, half a gill of brandy, salt and pepper. Cook all for fifteen minutes, then remove the meat from the shells, pound it to a paste, and dilute it with its own broth; strain through a sieve, and after- ward through a tammy; mix in one quart of bechamel (No. 409) ; warm up without boiling, and just when ready to serve, thicken the soup with twelve raw egg-yolks diluted in a quart of cream, and when the soup thickens, incorporate into it a quarter of a pound of lobster butter (No. 580). Put the following garnishing into a soup tureen, and pour the soup over. Remove the meat from the boiled lobster claws, cut the red part of it in slices an eighth of an inch thick, and from these punch out rounds three-quarters of an inch in diameter, using a column tube for the purpose; also have small, round quenelles, half an inch in diameter, made from the fillets of a pike or whiting in the shape of round beads.","208":"Cut twelve pounds of lobster lengthwise in two, break the claws, sprinkle over some butter, and cook them on a baking-sheet in a hot oven for twenty-five minutes. Remove them, and sup- press the largest shells, pound the meat with its equal quantity of plain boiled rice, seasoned with salt, pepper, and curry, and when all is well reduced to a paste, dilute it with broth; strain through a sieve and then a tammy, and warm up the soup without boiling; thicken it with twelve hard boiled egg-yolks pounded with four ounces of butter, and mix in also a pint of double cream, and serve as garnishing some mushrooms cut into fine Julienne and lobster quenelles. Put the soup into a tureen. Lobster Quenelles. — Cut one pound of cooked lobster meat in thin slices, add the coral and two ounces of butter; pound well and when reduced to a paste, take it from the mortar. Pound three quarters of a pound of panada, add gradually to it half a pound of butter, then the lobster paste, three eggs, one after the other, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and two tablespoons of Allemande sauce, test and rectify if necessary (No. 60). Roll this forcemeat to use for lobster quenelles, or else fill some sheeps' casings with it to make lobster boudins. (209). BISQUE OR PURÉE OF MUSSELS 1 LA GUTTING (Bisque ou PurSe de Moules a la Cutting. Clean well three gallons of raw mussels, scraping them with a knife; wash them several times in clean waters, and take them out with the hand so as not to disturb the sand settling at the bottom. Put them into a saucepan with minced onions, sprigs of parsley, pepper (no salt), and one pint of water; set the saucepan on the fire, and when they begin to get warm, toss them and return them to the fire; cover the pot, and toss them again frequently, until the mussels open and are well cooked, then take them off, and pick them from the shells, reserving about thirty of the smallest for the garnishing. Strain the juice, and let it rest so as to be able to pour off the top and avoid the sediment at the bottom, pound the mussels with as much pearl barley (half a pound) cooked in water, salt and butter, for three hours; moisten with the mussel gravy and water in case the soup be too thick; season with salt and red pepper, then strain all through a fine sieve or tammy; warm it without letting it boil, and just when ready to serve put in a piece of fresh butter, stirring it well into the soup with a spoon until it be melted. Garnish the soup with the thirty small mussels laid aside, and savarin croutons, a quarter of an inch square and dried in the oven. All lean bisques are made exactly the same as the fat ones, only substituting fish broth for meat, and garnishing with milts, scallops of sauted eel fillets, pike, quenelles with crawfish butter, crawfish tails, and the hearts of oysters. The sieve used for the bisque or puree is a round strainer made so as to fit in the mortar having a flange on the edge to fit the outside of it, the pestle is used to force the substance to be passed through it.","210":"Put sixty medium sized oysters in a saucepan with their own juice, set it on a hot fire to poach them; then drain. Fry colorless in some butter, two medium shallots and the same quantity of onions; dredge some curry over, and moisten with some of the oyster juice, season with salt and red pepper. Pound the oysters, and when they are a firm paste, wet them with some of their juice, and strain them through a fine sieve or tammy, warm them without boiling, adding a thick- ening of potato flour diluted in cold water, one tablespoonful for each quart, and when ready to serve, mix in some cream and fine butter; make a garnishing of chopped oysters and mushrooms.  mixing some bread-crumbs and fine herbs with these, and seasoning with salt, pepper and nutmeg; add some raw egg-yolks and roll this mixture into balls; lay them on a buttered baking sheet, and poach them in a slack oven. (211). BISQUE 01 SHRIMPS A LA VERAGUA (Bisque de Orevettes a la Veragua). Cut into small three-sixteenth of an inch squares, two ounces of carrots, four ounces of onions and two ounces of celery root; put into a saucepan six ounces of butter, fry therein the vegetables without browning and add three pounds of fresh, well washed shrimps, one bay leaf and several sprigs of parsley, also a bottleful of white wine and half a pound of chopped mushrooms. Boil for ten minutes, drain, remove the parsley and bay leaf, then shell a quarter of the shrimps, suppressing the tails, which must be laid aside for the garnishing, pound the rest of the shrimps with the shells of those the tails were taken from, add one-fourth of the same quantity of rice and moisten with the stock and broth; strain this puree through a sieve or tammy, add one pint of bechamel, season with salt and cayenne pepper; warm without boiling, and just when ready to serve, add to it a piece of fine butter and some cream. Serve the soup very hot, with Savarin crusts, five-eighths by one-eighth of an inch thick, and dried in the oven, also the shrimp tails cut into small squares.","212":"Throw one pound of shrimps into boiling, unsalted water and cook them for five minutes, drain, then dredge them over with salt and toss in a colander to mix the salt in well; when cold, shell the tails and keep them for garnishing. Mince one carrot, one onion, a celery stalk and two leeks, fry these in butter with one bay leaf and moisten with three quarts of either fish or vege- table stock and half a bottleful of wine; boil for twenty-five minutes, then put into this broth two pounds of raw shrimps and the shells of the tails reserved for the garnishing; boil for five minutes longer, then drain. Put into a stewpan two pounds of sliced bread, cover it with broth and let simmer for twenty minutes, then drain it on a sieve, pound the shrimps, add the moistened bread, and continue pounding until all is reduced to a paste, then dilute with the shrimp broth, and press all through a fine sieve, season and strain through a tammy. Heat it up till near the boiling point, but do not allow it to boil, then thicken with eight egg-yolks diluted with two gills of cream and a quarter of a pound of good butter, incorporating it vigorously into the bisque with a spoon, then pour it into a very hot tureen, with the shrimp tails cut into three or four pieces as a garn- ishing.","213":"Have three pounds of very fresh shrimps, throw them into boiling salted water and boil them for a few minutes, then drain and remove the shells from the largest ones, allowing three for each person; stuff these with pike forcemeat (No. 90), mixed with fine herbs; then poach them in boiling salted water, drain and keep them aside for garnishing the soup. Pound the remainder of the shrimps with a quarter of their quantity of crushed wheaten grits, previously cooked in water for thirty minutes, also twelve ounces of minced onion blanched and fried colorless in butter, adding to it six spoonfuls of flour diluted with milk, and cook all very slowly. Moisten the puree with broth, pass it through a sieve or tammy, put the puree into a saucepan, heat it to near the boiling point, then season with salt and cayenne pepper; when ready to serve add a piece of butter. Place the stuffed shrimp shells in the soup tureen, pour the soup over the puree and serve.","214":"Garnishings of Consommes. — Consomme garnishings are served separately, by placing them in a tureen and pouring over sufficient of the soup to cover them; having only a little consomme in the tureen it is easier to serve the garnishing without breaking; divide equally into each plate and pour over some clear consomme; in case the garnishing is to be served in the same tureen as the soup (to be avoided as much as possible) first put the consomme into the tureen, and then the garnishing that all may be very hot. The garnishings we are about to describe may be served with either beef, chicken, game or fish consomme, for the fish using the lean garnishings. Consommes can also be thickened with potato fecula or arrowroot, by diluting these substances in a little cold water or broth, pour it into the consomme, stirring it all the time with a whip, boil, skim and then add a little Madeira or Xeres wine. These soups are called clear thick soups when they are thickened either with fecula or arrowroot. 248 THE EPICUREAN.","215":"The admitted rule for all soups is one quart of soup for four persons. The garnishing con- sists of round chicken quenelles, three-sixteenths of an inch, poached in boiling water; green peas cooked in boiling, salted water, and carrots cut into balls the same size and shape, and cooked in white broth with a little sugar. Also timbales, twelve pieces in all. Dilute one-quarter of a pint of pure\"e of chestnuts with a quarter of a pint of cream and four egg-yolks, salt, and nutmeg; butter some dome shaped tartlet molds, put a round piece of truffle at the bottom, and then fill the molds with the above preparation; set one beside the other in a stewpan with boiling water reaching to half their height, and poach them in a slack oven; when firm to the touch, unmold and place them in a vegetable dish with the quenelles, carrots and green peas; pour over a little consomme, just sufficient to cover, and serve separately a tureen of consomme, having all very hot. Into each plate put some of the contents of the vegetable dish and tureen; this rule stands for all consomme garnishings, that is, one timbale, and a dozen and a half carrots, peas, and quenelles, inclusive.","216":"For this consomme prepare a garnishing composed of timbales, cucumber crescents, and small quenelles. The timbales are made with a pint of tomato puree strained through a very fine sieve; mix into this ten raw egg-yolks and a gill of cream; season with salt and nutmeg.

The first by making the soup in small soup-pots each one containing one-half a quart or more, diminishing the proportions of meat, vegetables and liquid, either of water or broth, after the proportions indicated in the pot-au-feu (No. 342). The second is to serve the pot-au-feu when it is ready, with the contents, dividing it into small individual pots, making an equal division of the meats, vegetables and liquid, into as many parts as there are half quarts of soup; and divide as well the meats, vegetables, and liquid into small two quart pots, having the meats and vegetables the same size as for the pint ones; for the one or the other use only half the beef meat well pared; the carrots, turnips, and celery cut into cylindricals, and divided into small parts, and each chicken into sixteen pieces; (Before using the small stone pots, they should be lined with the frag- ments of the chickens and vegetables, aromatics and spices, and cooked in the oven for twelve hours, pouring at intervals boiling water into them, so that they remain always full, then washed well out before using.) After the pots are filled, pour over the very hot broth, adding a table- spoonful of braised cabbage and the leeks divided, then boil the contents for a few minutes, and just when ready to serve, add for each pint four marrow bones sawed into inch thick pieces. Dress them over napkins on a plate.

Prepare an ordinary broth, obtaining it as clear as possible, strain, skim off the fat and let it deposit its sediment. Collect all the good meat from the large game, such as thighs, shoulders or breasts of hare or deer, also from old partridges, and the pinions and giblets from the pheasants or partridges.

The demi-glaze is not a sauce but simply good, clarified gelatinous gravy reduced to half the consistency of a glaze; which means only slightly thickened; it must be bright, clear, and succulent. Before taking it from the fire mix in with it a spoonful of Madeira wine for each two quarts of liquid.","401":"Have a stockpot sufficiently large to contain four pounds of knuckle of veal, eight pounds of shoulder of veal, six pounds of shin or leg of beef, and add to these sixteen quarts of water and a very little salt; boil, skim, and garnish with a pound and a half of onions, one of them contain- ing four cloves, two pounds of carrots cut in quarters, a bunch of eight medium sized leeks, with a few branches of celery, and a bouquet made of two ounces of parsley leaves, three bay leaves and as much thyme; bring to a boil, skim as fast as the fat and white particles rise to the surface, and boil in this manner for eight hours, then strain it through a sieve, and reduce down to two quarts.

Skim off the fat from all surplus stocks, and then strain them; should they be troubled, clarify with a little lean beef operating the sauce as for consomme. After the liquid is once strained, set it into one or several saucepans, pouring it off steadily from the sediment, and reduce the liquid quickly, while stirring it in the saucepan with a ladle, until it becomes slightly thick; now pour it into a smaller saucepan, and leave it to boil on one side of the fire, while skimming, until the glaze is quite thick, then pour it into cans and let it get cold in a cool place to use when needed.

Strain il again through the tammy and just when ready to use, incorporate into it half a pound of fine, fresh butter.","413":"A half glaze sauce only differs from an espagnole by its lightness. This sauce is generally made in large quantities at the time, so as not to begin it so frequently, as it requires the utmost care in its preparation. Heat in a saucepan one pound of clarified butter, and when it is very hot fill it up with flour so as to obtain a paste rather too light than otherwise; thicken it well while stirring for a few minutes on the fire, and then set it aside in a warm part to cook and brown very slowly, without adhering to the bottom of the pan, and without letting it get black. Five or six hours after, pour it into a vessel, cover it with paper, and let this roux stand to get cool. To make the Sauce : dilute the roux very slowly, with some beef stock (No. 194a), having it only slightly warm, and prepared for this purpose, and finish it exactly like the espagnole; it must be as clear as possible and of a light color; strain and skim it well. Stir the liquid over the fire to thicken the sauce, managing not to have any lumps in it, and should it not be perfectly smooth, then strain it through a fine colander Put four ounces of butter in a saucepan, add to it four ounces each of 294 THE EPICUREAN. sliced carrots, onions and celery root; the same quantity of lean ham cut in quarter inch squares, a bunch of parsley garnished with bay leaves, thyme and allspice, fry without coloring, pour the sauce over the whore, add four gills of good white, dry wine, and a quarter of a pound of mushroom parings, and let all boil while stirring, then remove it at once to the side of the range, and continue boiling on one side only, so as to be able to despumate it properly for several hours. Strain and put as much of this as is needed into a reducing saucepan with two gills of meat glaze (No. 401); boil, reduce it to the necessary degree, using a spatula to stir it from the bottom, without leaving it for one instant, incorporate slowly into it a little good veal blond (No. 423) and a small quantity of good white wine.

To obtain a good espagnole, it is necessary to have good stock (No. 421); in case there be no stock specially prepared for this purpose, use good clear broth. For four quarts of stock, melt in a saucepan one pound of butter, stir into it the same weight of very dry, good flour, so as to obtain a clear paste; then let it cook for four or five minutes on the fire, without ceasing to stir, and after- ward set it back on to a very slow fire, or in a slack oven, to let it get a good dark brown color, being careful to move it about often. When the roux is cooked, take it from the oven and dilute with the prepared stock, not having it too hot, and stir the liquid again over the fire to bring it to a boil. Should the sauce not be sufficiently smooth — should any lumps appear in it, then strain it through a fine sieve, and put it back into the saucepan; and at the first boil, set it on one side so that it only boils partially, and let it despumate in this way for two or three hours. Skim off well the fat, and strain the broth into a vessel to let get cold, meanwhile stirring frequently.","415":"The veloute like the espagnole is also a leading sauce used for making secondary sauces. Melt three-fourths of a pound of butter in a small saucepan; stir into it three-fourths of a pound of good flour, and let the roux cook for a few minutes, then set the saucepan on a slower fire with- out letting it color; in order to obtain a well thickened sauce, the flour must be well cooked. When the roux is sufficiently done dilute it gradually with four quarts of good stock (No. 423). In case there be no special stock prepared for this sauce then use some good clear chicken stock (No. 195). Stir the liquid over the fire until it comes to a boil, then move it aside to let it cook on one side only; despumate the sauce for one hour, skimming off all the white particles arising to the surface; remove all the fat, and strain the veloute through a sieve into a vessel and let it get cool while lifting off the scum that forms on the top.

There are several kinds of tinabales; those made with a very thin timbale paste; those of que- nelle forcemeat and those of cream forcemeat, either of chicken, game or fish. The name timbale should only be applied to those made of paste cylindrical-shaped like a footless goblet, or a silver mug, or else half spherical-shaped in imitation of the kettle-drum used in an orchestra and filled with a garnishing of some kind. A \"bung\" would better represent the idea of what is commonly called timbale, and I would suggest the adoption of the French of bung \" bondon, \" for I scarcely believe that the elegance of the bill of fare would be marred by reading: \" Bondons of Pickerel a la Walton,\" or \" Bondons of Chicken a la Reine,\" or \"Bondons of Woodcock a, la Diane,\" or \" Bondons of Pheasants a la Benois.\" I have not the slightest intention of changing the conventional name. I only suggest an idea that might he advantageously followed if so de- sired. For making timbales cylindrical molds (No. 2, Fig. 137) two and five-eighths inches wide by two and one-eighth inches high are generally used; butter the insides with fresh unmelted butter and decorate with fanciful cuts of truffles, tongue, pistachios, etc. They may also be strewn with truffles, tongue, lobster coral and pistachios, all these being chopped up finely and separate- ly, then dried in the air.

It is headless, toothless and sexless; it cannot live out of water, and is specially fond of the mouths of rivers. The fishing begins in September, and finishes in the latter part of April; in all the intervening months, or those containing no letter R in their names, the oysters are replaced by Little Neck clams. Fresh FIG. 275. oysters are easier digested in the raw state than when FIG. 276. cooked, for the heat hardens them while the sea water in the raw ones facilitates digestion. Oysters contain plenty of water, very little solid animal matter, a great deal of lime and sulphate of iron, osmazome and gelatin. These bivalves agree with worn-out constitutions, but should be eaten very fresh. Like certain fishes, oysters contain phosphorus.

The scarcity of Chesapeake diamond-back terrapin grows more apparent each year, and even now it frequently requires many days of laborious and tedious work and many miles of walking over soft boggy marshes, of prodding in deep narrow channels with long shafted tongs by men skilled and familiar with all their cunning habits before one is taken from a hiding place, just below the surface, sufficiently deep for protection against the winter frosts. The favorite place FlQ gyo for the hibernation of the very largest size is a few inches below the soft oozy mud at the bed of a three or four fathom V-shaped channel in the bed of a creek of about the same distance from shore to shore. Thousands of such creeks penetrate the shores and islands of the Chesapeake, and those less frequented by man are instinctively selected by the terrapin for its haunts. At least ninety per cent, of those taken from the beds of deep creeks will measure six and one-half to eight and one-half inches with an average weight of nearly two and three-fourths pounds, are females; while eighty per cent, of those bedded in the marshes have an average weight of three-fourths of a pound and measure less than five inches. The males invariably bed in the marshes and among the rushes of very shallow ponds, only venturing in cold water during the summer and the warm- est spring and fall months, in which time they lead a migratory life in search of food, consisting principally of small shell fish and the soft-shell crabs. About ninety-eight per cent, of the male terrapin never exceed five inches in length on the bottom shell, while the female has been known to measure nine inches and weigh seven and one-half pounds. In the month of December, 1885, Delmonico received from Baltimore a Chesapeake Maryland terrapin measuring eight and three-fourths inches, weighing nine and one-half pounds and containing fifty-six eggs; this must be accepted as one of the finest specimens ever found of the diamond-back Chesapeake bay terrapin. The standard length for those who buy and sell terrapin is six inches; when of this dimension they are called \"counts.\" Both the male and female are very shy and active, swim well and run (though awkwardly) with considerable speed. Prior to about 1870 the salt and brackish waters of the bay literally teemed with this now nearly exterminated and hence valuable reptile; they could betaken by the dozen at a single haul of a long net, but the market value was so small as to render them almost worthless except for local use, and in consequence thousands of large egg terrapin were fed away to swine or cooked for fattening fowls. The people, thoughtless and unprincipled, have robbed themselves by trapping incalculable quantities of terrapin before they had matured sufficiently for breeding and by digging eggs from beneath the sand shores where they had been deposited by the females to hatch. While the laws enacted by the legislatures of Maryland and Virginia for their protection differ somewhat they are both excellent, and had they been rigidly enforced this spectacle of ultimate extermination would not exist. The time for hibernation usu- ally lasts about six months, beginning with approaching frosty weather in the fall and continuing till the warm spring weather; they bury a few inches deep in the mud and leave, at the spot where they disappear, a mound in the middle of which a hole can be discerned. It is this mound and its hole which first attracts the attention of the fisherman; during this period an enormous quantity of terrapin are caught in their torpid state. They take no nourishment whatever while in this condition. They hatch their young toward the end of June and the beginning of July. The terrapin season is from the month of November to May; they are at their best during Decem- ber, January, February and March. Very often terrapin are sent to market in October and Nov- ember, also penned terrapin of the year before. Penned Terrapin.— Are those caught beforehand and kept in an enclosed place; they are fed on oysters, crabs or fish; these terrapin are never so good as those freshly caught. The small species of terrapin are divided into two classes: heifers, the under shell of these never measuring more than five inches in length, and bulls five to five and a half.

The prices quoted above are the actual prices of terrapins in New York, Baltimore and Cris- fleld, and are liable to fluctuate according to the market supply; this can be overcome by diminish- ing or augmenting the price per pound. The letters in the four divisions of the table No. 1, refer to sizes of the terrapins. A., denotes terrapins from five to six inches; B. from six to seven, etc. To make use of these tables: Weigh the terrapins and barrel as received, deduct weight of barrel, grass, etc., which will leave the net weight. Sort the terrapins by sizes in differences of a quarter of an inch, using the measure shown in Fig. 281. Weigh the terrapins of each size by 422 THE EPICUREAN. ounces, then find the average weight of each, refer to table No. 2, looking in the first column for the corresponding length, then find in what column their average weight in ounces is found; in this same section will be found their price by the pound; for instance: a seven and three-quarter inch terrapin weighing 64 ounces at $2.05 cents a pound will cost $8.20, or one dozen will cost $98.40.

MOLLUSKS AND CRUSTACEANS. 423 To Select Terrapin.— To buy terrapin See Schedules or Tables Nos. 1 and 2. When buying terrapin be careful to observe that the extreme tip or muzzle of the head is not injured, that the bottom of the feet are not worn off, that the head is prettily shaped, small thin and pointed, the eyes brilliant and the feet small and slender. The superiority of their race is made apparent by their fine appearance. There is no doubt that the diamond-back Chesapeake bay terrapin are far better than any other kind found in the markets. Their price is very high, they being sold on an average of the five to six inch ones or over at a $1.25 a pound or $15.00 to $17.00 a dozen; the six to seven inch ones bring $1.50 a pound or $35.00 to $40.00 a dozen; the seven to eight inch ones bring $1.75 a pound or $55.00 to $60.00 a dozen; the eight to nine inches bring $1.90 a pound or $80.00 to $85.00 a dozen. They should be procured before the extreme cold weather sets into avoid freezing during the trip, for once frost bitten they die easily. To Keep the Terrapin.— In order to keep them properly they must be left in a cold place forty to forty-five degrees Fahrenheit; it should also be clean, well aired, dark and better be too damp than too dry. They must be placed in large or small boxes according to the quantity; range the terrapin in the boxes, pressing them down one beside the other so that they cannot possibly move, and between each bed lay damp sea grass. When packed like this they may be kept for several months. Examine the terrapin now and then. Should there be any dead ones take them out. They must be handled with care, laid one next to the other, not thrown, as they are very tender and delicate and are liable to die easily, incurring a heavy loss, as a dead terrapin is a ruined one and ought to be thrown away at once. No eggs are found in terrapin of less than six inches long.","1082":"Drop the terrapin in sufficient tepid water to allow it to swim, and leave them thus for half an hour, then change the water several times and wash them well. Scald, by plunging them into boiling water, and take out as quickly as the skin (a small white skin on the head and feet) can be removed with a cloth, put them on to cook in water without any salt or seasoning, or else in a steam vessel leaving them for thirty to forty-five minutes, and lift them out as quickly as they are done. In order to be sure of this, press the feet meat between the fingers, and if it yields easily under the pressure, they are ready. Those that cannot be cooked in forty-five minutes are considered of an inferior quality, and those that are not done after one hour (unless they are very large), should be rejected as worthless, for although the meat may eventually become tender, it will be stringy and not have the same delicate taste of a good terrapin. Let them get cold, cut off the nails, then break the shell on the flat side, on both sides near the upper or top one; detach this shell from the meats, empty out all the insides found in this upper shell, suppressing the entrails and lights, and carefully removing the gall bladder from the liver, being very particular not to break it, also cutting away with the tip of a small knife any gall spots to be found thereon, then place the liver in cold water. Remove the white inside muscles, as well as the head and tail; separate the legs at their joints and divide into an inch and a quarter pieces; do not break the bones; the lights, entrails, head, tail, claws, heart, muscles and gall bladder to be thrown away. Lay the terrapin in a saucepan with the eggs and liver cut in thin slices, season with salt, black pepper and cayenne, and cover with sufficient water to attain to the heighth of the terrapin, then let boil and finish the cooking in a slow oven for twenty to thirty minutes; the terrapin is now ready to be used, and can easily be finished by following the recipes found later on. Should it only be required for the next day, place in tin molds or else small China pots, the proportions being at the inside bottom two and three-eighths inches, on top, three inches in diameter, and two and three-eighth inches high. Allow four or six eggs to each, fill them up with terrapin, about six ounces for each, and finish filling with the broth; each mold will contain one portion. When unmolded each one should weigh seven ounces. This quantity will be sufficient for two or three persons for a dinner and for five persons for a buffet.","1083":"Have one quart of prepared terrapin as explained in No. 1082; drain it off. Cook four ounces of butter in a saucepan till it becomes hazelnut butter (No. 567), but watch carefully that it does not blacken; add to it the terrapin with some salt, freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of cayenne, fry for few moments, then moisten with the broth. Dilute one tablespoonful of fecula, arrowroot or cornstarch in a little cold water, pour it in with the terrapin, toss well to thicken nicely, and just when 424 THE EPICUREAN ready to serve add half a gill of good sherry wine. After the terrapin has been prepared it is served in chafing dishes kept warm by water boiling continuously by means of an alcohol lamp, FIG. 282. FIG. 283. or else in small silver plated saucepans (Fig. 282) or in China terrapins (Fig. 283), the backs of which are loose and are used as covers; whichever way may be chosen, be most particular that the terrapin is always served very hot.","1084":"Heat well four ounces of butter in a sautoir, and place a quart of cooked and drained terrapin into it, season with salt and cayenne, and fry the terrapin for a few minutes, then add one pint of good fresh cream. Reduce this cream to half, thickening with a tablespoonful of rice flour diluted with half a gill of sweet cream; pour in when ready to serve, half a gill of good sherry wine.","1085":"Pound eight hard egg-yolks, with four ounces of butter; then pass through a sieve. Prepare and cook one quart of terrapin as explained for No. 1082, add a pint of cream, let boil for five minutes, then thicken it with the prepared egg-yolks and butter, and let simmer for ten minutes, seasoning with salt, and white or cayenne pepper; just when serving mix in half a gill of good sherry or Madeira wine.","1086":"Prepare and cook the terrapin the same as No. 1082. For each quart, add a half a pint of cream, reduce to half, season with salt and cayenne pepper, thicken with five raw egg-yolks diluted with half a pint of cream, and two ounces of fresh butter, toss the terrapin while adding the thickening; this must not boil, finishing with half a gill of very good sherry wine or Madeira. The sauce should be thick and served very hot.","1087":"Choose a six and a half inch terrapin, scald to remove the skin, and wrap it in several sheets of buttered paper; put it on a baking sheet and set it into a slow oven; it will take about an hour to cook; unwrap, and break the shell; remove the meats, suppress the gall-bag attached to the liver, also any spots found on the same, and cut it up into slices; take away the head, tail, claws, and white muscles on the four members, and then warm the terrapin in a good thick gravy (No. 405), season with salt, freshly ground pepper, cayenne, butter, adding some good sherry wine. Serve on a chafing dish.","1088":"Have the terrapin ready and cooked as for No. 1082. For one quart of it, place four ounces of butter in a sautoir on the fire; let it heat and skim it well until it begins to become (nut but- ter) ; add to it the terrapin, and season with salt, cayenne and black pepper, also half a gill of good sherry. It can also be prepared by placing it in a chafing dish with salt, cayenne, fresh but- ter, and half a gill of good sherry.","1089":"Have a pound and a half of cooked and boneless terrapin, cut in half inch squares; put these on the fire in a stewpan, seasoning with salt and red pepper; heat well and thicken with egg-yolks, butter, and cream moistened with a little good sherry; let get partially cold and then mold in cutlet-shaped MOLLUSKS AND CRUSTACEANS. 425 bottomless molds laid on a sheet of heavy buttered paper slightly larger than the mold itself, and set on level baking tins. Fill the molds to the top with terrapin, lay them on ice, and when the preparation is perfectly cold, unmold and dip the cutlets into beaten eggs, roll in bread-crumbs, then fry them in clarified butter; wipe and dress crown-shaped on folded napkins, garnishing the center with fried green parsley. If for croquettes mold the terrapin in timbale molds (No. 2, Fig. 137) and finish the same as the cutlets; serve a cream sauce (No. 545) separately.","1090":"WINE (Bagoiit de Terrapene au Madere), After the terrapin have been cut up, fry them in butter, then dredge over a little flour that has been browned in the oven. Fry once more for a few minutes, moisten with half white wine and half broth (No. 194a), season with salt and pepper, and let simmer and despumate for twenty minutes; finish cooking in the oven for thirty or forty minutes longer, and just when prepared to serve, add a little good Sherry or Madeira wine. (1090a), TERRAPIN A LA TRENTON (Terrapene a la Trenton). Prepare two terrapins, each weighing three pounds; when cooked and ready, as explained in No. 1082, add one pint of cream and reduce to half ; then thicken with three hard-boiled eggs reduced to a paste with three,ounccs of butter and three coffeespoonfuls of fecula diluted in three spoonfuls of good sherry. Season with salt, freshly ground black pepper, a teaspoonful of paprika and a teaspoonful of powdered sweet Spanish peppers; finish with a little good sherry. (1090b), TERRAPIN, EPICUREAN STYLE (Terrapene a rEpicurienne). The diamond-back Chesapeake, Maryland terrapins are considered the best. They must be freshly caught. Long Island terrapins are also much liked by epicures, some averring that they are as fine as the Chesapeake, but this is not a fact, and I do not hesitate to class them according to the following order : First, the Chesapeake, then the Long Island, Virginia, Charleston and Savannah, North Carolina, Florida, Mississippi and Texas, the Gulf, Mobile, etc. Take two terra- pins, each one of three pounds weight, and prepare them as described in No. 1082. Fry in two ounces of butter, adding two ounces of rice flour well mingled in; moisten with water as high as the terrapin and let boil until thoroughly cooked, seasoning with salt and pepper; add a pint of cream and reduce; finish with three hard-boiled egg-yolks, pounded and formed into a. paste with three tablespoorifuls of good sherry wine. Serve separately on a folded napkin some: very small oysters, drained and rolled in cracker dust, then fried in butter; surround these with quartered lemons. TURTLE (Tortue), An amphibious quadruped, having all its body, except the head, feet, and tail, covered with a very hard shell. It is enclosed in a cuirass composed of two pieces; the one covering the back is FIG. 284. called the carapace; this is convex shaped; the vertebra are attached to it. The underneath one is attached to the breast; this is flat and is called the plastron. The choicest and most delicate part of the turtle is that attached to the upper shell- 426 THE EPICUREAN.","1091":"Lard the fins of a turtle with calf's udder, braise them in a mirepoix stock (No. 419), moistened with Madeira, and when the turtle is cooked, take out the stock and put it into a flat saucepan with an equal quantity of espagnole sauce (No. 414); reduce and despumate; add some finely shreded green peppers, peeled and quartered tomatoes, Spanish olives stuffed with anchovies and fish quenelles (No. 90) ; glaze the turtle with meat glaze (No. 402), dress with the garnishing around, and serve. (1092), GREEN TUETLE BAKED— SMALL (Petite Tortue Verte an Gratin). Obtain a young turtle weighing ten pounds; remove and lard the meat with small lardons; clean well the carapace; braise the meats in a mirepoix stock (No. 419) with the belly shells, letting the meats be well cooked, and the braise stock reduced to half; transfer the meats to a vessel, strain the stock over and let it get cold. Cut the meats up into quarter inch squares, as well as the cutaneous parts from the belly. Fry in butter four ounces of onions cut in squares; sift over some flour, and moisten with the stock; add the turtle meat; stir the preparation until it comes to a boil, .season and thicken with hard boiled egg-yolks mixed with an equal quantity of butter, and press through a fine sieve. Add some parsley and finely chopped raw mushrooms; then use this stew to fill up the carapace or deep shell; bestrew over with bread-raspings, besprinkle with butter and brown a nice color in a slow oven; serve when very hot.","1093":"Cut the turtle meat into one inch and a quarter squares; fry them in butter, and sprinkle over with flour, stir well, then moisten with broth, adding a bunch of parsley garnished with thyme and bay leaf, small onions, a piece of bacon cut into three-sixteenth inch squares, and mushrooms cut the same; season with salt, black and red pepper, this should not be confused with cayenne pepper, they are entirely different (No. 168); when the stew is done and ready to serve, pour in a little Madeira wine, suppress the parsley, reduce it properly and serve. OPoisson).","1094":"Prepare a wine court bouillon (No. 39), dress an angel or moon fish, tying down the head. Place this fish on a fish kettle grate; just cover it with the court bouillon, bring to a boil and simmer gently until cooked through. Dress on a folded napkin and serve with an appropriate sauce.","1095":"Cut the bass through its entire length in two; suppress the fillet skin and remove the back bone; divide each fillet in two lengthwise pieces, then into slices, half an inch thick; have twelve of these paring them all into half-hearts; range them in a well buttered sautoir, one beside the other, moistening to their height with a mirepoix stock (No. 419). Cover over with a sheet of buttered paper, and set this into a slow oven to cook, then transfer the fillets on a dish, and strain the broth over the fillets; when cold remove them entirely from what now should be a jelly; reduce some veloute sauce (No. 415) with this jelly and mushroom essence (No. 392); when reduced quite thick, add chopped mushrooms and fine herbs and set it aside to get partially cold; cover the entire fillets with this, leave them until perfectly cold, then pare nicely and dip in beaten eggs, roll in bread-crumbs and fry to a fine color in clarified butter; dress crown shaped on a folded napkin with fried parsley in the center and quartered lemon around. Serve a separate sauce-boat of the following sauce: Chop up one shallot, fry it in butter, add to it twelve small finely minced clams without any liquor, and moisten with a pint of unsalted bechamel (No. 409). Season to taste; when ready to serve thicken with egg-yolks and cream, incorporating a good sized piece of fresh butter, lemon juice and chopped parsley.","1096":"Pare twelve fillets of black bass free of skin, shaping into aiguillettes; season with salt and pepper, then put them into a sautoir, and moisten with fish stock (No. 195) and the oyster crab broth; cook in a slow oven, basting them frequently while they are cooking, then drain off the liquid and reduce it with the same quantity of veloute sauce (No. 415). Just when prepared to serve, incorporate into it a good sized piece of butter, then strain through a tammy. Put the oyster crabs into a sautoir with a little white wine, set it on the fire, and at the first boil drain them well. Dress the fish in two straight rows on a long dish; set the oyster crabs between these two rows, and cover the whole with half of the sauce, serving the other half separately.","1097":"Split the bass lengthwise on the belly side to the back, but do not separate the pieces; take out the backbone; season with salt, baste with a little oil, besprinkle with fresh bread-crumbs, and broil over a slow fire, turning it once only; when done dress on a hot dish. Garnish around with sweet peppers fried in oil with a little crushed and chopped garlic, salt, black and prepared red pepper (No. 168), fine herbs and lemon juice. (487) 428 THE EPICUREAN.","1098":"WATER FISH (Bass Rouge. \"Water Fish\"). Cut into short Julienne some carrots, leeks, parsley root and celery root; slice or cut some onions into squares, and put all into a saucepan to moisten with fish broth (No. 195); boil and reduce to a glaze; moisten again with water, add salt and the fish whole, cooking it in this court bouillon. Drain, reduce the stock, thickening it with a little veloute sauce (No. 415), the juice of a lemon, and butter; mix in with it blanched parsley leaves. Dress the fish on a folded napkin, surround with sprigs of parsley and serve the sauce separate.","1099":"Remove the fillets, bones, and skin from a sea bass; pare the fillets into half-heart shapes and season each piece with salt and pepper; saute these in butter with lemon juice, and take them out singly to place on a baking sheet; set a light weight on top; when cold pare them exactly alike and cover over with a well reduced allemande sauce (No. 407) and a little jelly, into which has been added finely chopped mushrooms and parsley; let get very cold, then bread-crumb them by rolling them first in bread-crumbs, afterward in beaten eggs, and once more in the bread-crumbs; smooth the surfaces with the blade of a knife, and lay them at the bottom of a wire basket; plunge it in very hot frying fat, taking them out when a fine color; dress on napkins and serve with fried pars- ley as a garnishing.","1100":"Remove the fillets from the fish ; season them with salt and pepper, saturate with oil, and broil over a slow fire without browing; dress and surround the fillets with potato balls three- quarters of an inch in diameter, first boiled, then sauted in butter. Cover the surface of the fish with slightly melted almond butter (No. 568), and besprinkle the potatoes with finely chopped parsley.","1101":"Prepare two small bass each of two pounds, and when very clean cut the heads into pieces, add- ing a few large bones from other fish; put all these into a small saucepan and moisten to their height with a good fish court bouillon, prepared with white wine (No. 39) ; season, let the liquid boil for a quarter of an hour so as to extract all the essence from the bones, then strain and skim FIG. 285. off the fat. Have a small oval baking-tin with raised edges, just large enough to hold the fillets of fish; sprinkle over with chopped up onions, shallots, and mushroom parings; lay the fillets of fish on top and moisten to its heigh th with some of the above court bouillon; after the liquid has come to a boil, set the pan into a moderate oven so that the fish cooks for fifteen minutes, then drain and dress the fillets on a medium sized dish covering it with a smaller one to keep it hot. Strain the broth, free it from fat, and pour into it two spoonfuls of good white wine, then let it reduce to the consistency of a half-glaze; take it off, stir in a piece of butter, finishing with lemon juice; pour this sauce over the fish. Glazt this sauce immediately with an iron or gas sala- mander for two minutes, or if there be neither, lay the dish on a thick baking sheet and set it in a brisk oven, being careful not to disturb the sauce. The delicacy of this preparation depends entirely upon the excellence of the court bouillon.","1102":"Lift the fillets of bass; suppress the skin and trim them into half inch thick slices, paring them into half-hearts, two inches by two and a half; season. Cut also from the fish small strips three inches long, and three-quarters of an inch wide, sloping the ends down to points; make five or six bias incisions through half their thickness and fill each one with a slice of very green pickled gherkin; lay these strips on the largest end of the fillet, shaping them like a horseshoe, and place the fillets in a buttered sautoir; moisten with a good white wine court-bouillon (No. 39), and cover over with a sheet of strong buttered paper; bring the liquid to a boil and finish cooking in a slow oven for ten to fifteen minutes. Dress and garnish with three-quarters of an inch ball-shaped potato croquettes (No. 2782), strain the broth and reduce it to the consistency of a glaze, finishing the sauce with a good sized piece of butter, stirring it in with a wire whisk, also the juice of a lemon and chopped parsley.","1103":"Liftoff the fillets from several bass, three-quarters of a pound each; suppress the skin and beat them down with the handle of a knife, fold them in two in the center, and trim them half heart- shaped, then lay them in a buttered sautoir and moisten with a good court bouillon (No. 38). Prepare small pike quenelles (No. 90), some oysters or mussels and mushrooms; have a veloute sauce (No. 415), reduced with some of the court bouillon and thickened with egg-yolks and cream; strain through a sieve and keep half of it aside; to the other half add the quenelles, mushrooms and oysters. Dress the well-drained fish crown-shaped, fill the center with the stew, and cover the fish with half of the remaining sauce, sending the other halt to the table in a sauce-boat. Do not garnish the fish with potatoes, when the sauce is poured over it, serve them separately.","1104":"After the bass has been dressed and cleaned remove the fillets and meats adhering to the skin, trimming them into half inch thick slices shaped like half-hearts, three and a half inches by two; place on a baking sheet, cover with buttered paper, and poach them in butter and a court bouillon (No. 38); let get slightly cold under the pressure of a weight; drain and pare them again. Pre- pare a good essence (No. 388), with the heads and bones of the fish; skim off the fat and strain, then slowly incorporate into it one quart of reduced veloute (No. 415); add a little oyster liquor and mushroom essence (No. 392), and when the sauce is properly reduced and of a sufficient succulence, thicken it with egg-yolks and finish with a piece of crawfish butter (No. 573) ; when partly cold cover the fillets with a thick layer of this sauce, and set them aside to get cold. Dip each piece of fish into beaten eggs, bread-crumbs, and fry of a good color in clarified butter, drain and dress on folded napkins.","1105":"Procure small bass weighing from four to six ounces; cleanse and wash them well; wipe dry and remove the skin on each side; season with salt and coat over with butter; wrap them up in heavy oiled paper, then broil them for fifteen or twenty minutes; unwrap and dress them on a dish; glaze over with lobster butter (No. 580), and surround with oyster bellies and pike quenelles (No. 734). Cover these garnishings with lobster sauce (No. 488), and serve at the same time a separate bowl of the sauce. (1106). STRIPED BASS A LA MASSENA— WHOLE (Bass Eay6 a la Masse~na— Entier).

Cook again for a few minutes, season with salt, a dash of cayenne pepper, and finish with a little fresh butter. To thicken smoked beef with cream a little bechamel sauce (No. 409) may be used instead of fecula.","1359":"Put two pounds of tenderloin of beef in the chopping machine (Fig. 173); this machine is far superior to any other, for in chopping the meats the sinews and other hard parts collect at the bottom of the machine, on the shelf; the meat arising to the surface is the best part; take this out, leaving the hard, fibrous pieces at the bottom. Mold the Salisbury steak in a ring three- quarters of an inch high by three inches in diameter or else in a small empty goose-liver terrine (No. 10).

When finished, lay the steak on a very hot dish, covering it with maitre d'hotel butter (No. 581). It is easy to find out when the meat is done. Press lightly in the center with the first finger, and if the meat be soft, and offering a slight resistance, then it is cooked rare; to have it done properly it must be firm, without resisting as much to the touch; and to be well done, it must be firm, and offer resistance. Practice alone can teach how to cook by the touch, which differs according to the quality of the meat. (1363).
